Specifically, this data is accessible only to\nadmins and not regular users. Through testing, I discovered that when\na user accesses the group section of the application and intercepts\nthe response for the corresponding request, certain attributes are\nprovided in the JSON response. By manipulating these attributes, a\nuser can gain access to tabs restricted to administrators. Upon\nreporting this issue, it was duly acknowledged and promptly resolved\nby the developers.\n\n\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1) User with the least previlages needs to neviagte to the group section.\n2) Intercept the response for the group requets.\n3) In the response modify the certian paramters : \"\n*\"system\":0,\"private\":0,\"isMember\":true,\"isPending\":true,\"isInvited\":true,\"isOwner\":true,\"isAdmin\":true,\n**\" *\".\n4) Forward the request and we can see that attacker can access the\nrestricted information.\n\n*Impact:*\nAttacker was able to access the restricted tabs for the Admin group\nwhich are only allowed the the administrators.\n            "}
