This allows an\nattacker to compromise the super-admin account, leading to potential theft\nof cookies and session tokens.\n\n## Background:\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a common web security vulnerability that\ncompromises user interactions with a vulnerable application. Stored XSS\noccurs when user input is stored in the application and executed whenever a\nuser triggers or visits the page.\n\n## Issue:\n\nLimeSurvey fails to properly validate user-supplied input on both client\nand server sides, despite some protective measures. The \"Administrator\nemail address:\" field within the \"General Setting\" functionality permits\nthe insertion of special characters, enabling the injection of malicious\nJavaScript payloads. These payloads are stored in the database and executed\nwhen the user saves or reloads the page.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Log into the LimeSurvey application.\n2. Navigate to the general settings.\n3. Insert the following JavaScript payload in the \"Administrator email\naddress:\" field:\nPayload: `abcxyz@gmail.com\"><u>s</u><svg\nonload=confirm(document.domain)>`\n\n## Expected Result:\n\nThe LimeSurvey application should display an alert with the domain after\nclicking save and reloading the page.\n\n## Actual Result:\n\nThe LimeSurvey application is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting, as\nevidenced by the successful execution of the injected payload.\n\n## Proof of Concept:\n\nAttached Screenshots for the reference.\n            "}
