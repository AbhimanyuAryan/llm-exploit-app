Log in to the administrator panel.\n2. Navigate to 'file' > 'Filelist' section.\n3. Right-click on a file storage and select 'New.'\n4. Set the base URI to \"../../../\" and save.\n\nAfter creating the file storage, the final HTTP request should resemble the one below. Once the file storage is created, refresh the page, enabling you to browse any directory on the server.\n\nTo access \"/etc/passwd,\" browse to the '/etc/' directory, search for 'passwd,' and view the file.\n            "}
