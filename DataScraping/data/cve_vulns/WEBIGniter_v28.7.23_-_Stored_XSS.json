This code, when embedded within an image tag like this: <img src onerror=\"prompt(8)\">, can be executed when the user navigates to the \"users\" page under their profile.\n\n## Mitigation\nTo mitigate this risk, the \"your_name\" parameter should be subjected to rigorous input validation and encoding to ensure that all user input is sanitized and rendered harmless.\n            "}
