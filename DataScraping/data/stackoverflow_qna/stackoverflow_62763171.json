{"questionTitle": "&#39;NoneType&#39; object has no attribute &#39;secret_key&#39;", "question": "<p>I got this error : <strong>''NoneType' object has no attribute 'secret_key''</strong> when I tried to update my application using <strong>git pull</strong>.I have already configured the AWS credentials at the following path : <strong>nano /home/$USER/.aws/config</strong> . I let it (the archive that I mentioned) as follows :</p>\n<pre><code>[profile eb-cli]\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&lt;confidential&gt;\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;confidential&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>How can I solve this problem ?</p>\n", "acceptedAnswer": "<p>I know it's an old question but i got the same here today. I had two profiles in <code>.aws/config</code> which used to work before.</p>\n<p>However - Calling <code>aws configure</code> and enter the information's solved the issue form me. The command creates/modifies two separate files (config &amp; credentials) in the .aws directory and it has added a <code>[default]</code> section, which i did not had before. I assume you can do this also manually and copy your existing profile block as default. Hope this helps.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/configure/index.html</a></p>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62763171/nonetype-object-has-no-attribute-secret-key"}
