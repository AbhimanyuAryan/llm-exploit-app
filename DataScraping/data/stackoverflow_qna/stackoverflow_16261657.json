One thing that irritates me is that every time I create a new directory using <code>mkdir</code> I have to <code>cd</code> to change to it. Is there a single command solution to create and switch to the directory just created?</p>\n\n<p>Right now I do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mkdir php5\ncd php5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can I do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mkdir -someswitch php5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want something simple and clean. A good example is <code>git branch somebranch</code> which makes new branch and <code>git checkout -b somebranch</code> which makes and switches to new branch.</p>\n", "acceptedAnswer": "<p>Found some magic:</p>\n<pre><code>mkdir foo &amp;&amp; cd $_\n</code></pre>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16261657/how-to-mkdir-and-switch-to-new-directory-in-one-line"}
