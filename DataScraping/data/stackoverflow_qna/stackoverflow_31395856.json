It's a great DB for development/quick prototypes, though.</p>\n<p>Heroku <em>do</em> have <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/postgres\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a Postgres offering</a> however that will suit - with a free tier and a basic $9/month tier that are good for hobby/small projects. The biggest benefit over SQLite is that you get backups that you wouldn't get otherwise (plus all the other Postgres features).</p>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31395856/django-deploying-an-application-on-heroku-with-sqlite3-as-the-database"}
