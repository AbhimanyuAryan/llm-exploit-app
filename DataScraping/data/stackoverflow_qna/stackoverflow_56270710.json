{"questionTitle": "SFSpeechRecognizer multiple languages", "question": "<p>I am building a search that supports voice recognition and transforms speech to text so I am using <code>SFSpeechRecognizer</code>.

Anyway, I noticed that if I set one locale (for example Italian) and then the user speaks in English, the system gets some English too. This works just for English... I'm not sure, but I suppose that whatever locale you set, English is always understood by default.</p>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56270710/sfspeechrecognizer-multiple-languages"}
