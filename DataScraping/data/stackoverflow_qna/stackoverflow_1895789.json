{"questionTitle": "What does &quot;hard coded&quot; mean?", "question": "<p>My assignment asks me to access a <code>test.txt</code> document, so the file name has to be hard coded to my C drive. I have no idea what hardcoding means. Can somebody please help me with this?</p>\n", "acceptedAnswer": "<p>\"hard coding\" means putting something into your source code.  If you are <em>not</em> hard coding, then you do something like prompting the user for the data, or allow the user to put the data on the command line, or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>So, to hard code the location of the file as being on the C: drive, you would just put the pathname of the file all together in your source code.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main()\n{\n    const char *filename = \"C:\\\\myfile.txt\";\n\n    printf(\"Filename is: %s\\n\", filename);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The file name is \"hard coded\" as: <code>C:\\myfile.txt</code></p>\n\n<p>The reason the backslash is doubled is because backslashes are special in C strings.</p>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895789/what-does-hard-coded-mean"}
