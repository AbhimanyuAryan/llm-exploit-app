The first loop will scan individually and will store in the sum array by adding with the previous input. Then, in the 2nd loop it will scan the range and will print the summation.

Then you can get value at a specific index with mov ax, [line + BX] where BX is element index * 2 (since each element is 2 bytes long).\nAlternatively you can put the starting address of line into BX, and then just add index * 2 directly to it.\nLet's say index we want to get is in CX, then the code would be\nmov bx, line\nshl cx       ; CX *= 2\nadd bx, cx\nmov ax, [bx]\n\n",

        "Title": "Does array.map() starts iterating from the 1st element throughout the array?",
        "Question": "Is n automatically set to represent array indexes starting from 0? What confuses me is that I usually set up for loops to define i as an index indicator. But here how does n do it without being set that way?\nx is an array\nfunction maps(x){\n  return x.map(\n    function (n) {\n      return n*2\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nI was trying to double each element of an array. And i actually figured it out but my question is \"how does it actually work?\".\n",
        "Answer": "The function (n) { return n*2 } is accepted as an argument of a callback function by the map() method. So function (n) { return n*2 } executes for each element in the array x and its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The parameter n represents the current element being processed in the array and the second parameter should be the index of the current element being processed in the array. For example, we can turn your code snippet as the following:\nlet arr = [30, 51, 76];\n\nfunction maps(x){ \n    return x.map( function (n, index) {\n        console.log(n + \" \" + index);\n        return n*2;\n    } ) \n}\n\nconsole.log(maps(arr));\n\nThen we should get the result:\n30 0\n51 1\n76 2\n[ 60, 102, 152 ]\n\nAnd we can see the indices that correspond to the elements.\nI think the best way to eliminate your confusion is to figure it out how the map() method is defined. Here, I cite a piece of code snippet from https://jsvault.com/array-map to show what exactly is a map() method:\n/**\n * The callback gets 3 arguments\n * the item, the index and the  execution context\n */\nArray.prototype.newMap = function (callback) {\n  const result = [];\n  for (let index = 0; index < this.length; index++) {\n    // This is primarily to check if the item\n    // exists in the array, \n    if (this.indexOf(this[index]) > -1) {\n      result[index] = callback(this[index], index, this)\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n\nWithin the definition, there is a for loop to handle a callback function, in which case, it could be your function (n) { return n*2 }.\nIf you want to know more details, please check the links https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\nand\nhttps://jsvault.com/array-map\n",

Apparantly your numes (names in the list) variable is word-sized and you would like to extend the byte-sized response from the user to a full word. mov al, al does not do that, you need mov ah, 0 (or cbw for these very small positive numbers).\nFor a solution consider this: although the user will work with indexes starting at 1, the program should be using 0 as the first index as it will simplify things a lot.\nsub  al, '0'     ; AL=[1,9]\ncbw              ; AX=[1,9]   1-based index\ndec  ax          ; AX=[0,8]   0-based index\ncmp  ax, numes   ; numes is [0,9]\njae  invalidIndex\n\n\nmov di, si\n\n\nYou are setting up for your shiftloop with identical pointers for the source and the destination!

Each of your iterations just moves a single byte where in fact you should be moving 6 bytes (5 + 1), so you're copying not nearly enough!\nSolution for sterge\nLet's assume there are 4 names on the list, so numes=4:\n1.elena\n2.maria\n3.daria\n4.adria\n\nValid user inputs would be 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the validation code will turn this into AL ranging from 0 to 3.\nMultiplying this number by 6 will give us the offset in the list where we find the name that is to be deleted. The part of the list that needs to be shifted down in memory then starts 6 bytes above that. It is possible for this part to be empty if the topmost item was selected for deletion. My code below uses the rep movsb instruction that will work fine even if there's nothing to copy.\n  ...\n\n  sub  al, 49      ; AL=[\"1\",\"9\"] 1-based input -> AL=[0,8] 0-based index\n  mov  ah, 6\n  mul  ah          ; -> AX = {0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48}\n  add  ax, offset nume\n  cmp  ax, numePointer\n  jnb  invalidIndex\n  mov  di, ax\n  lea  si, [di + 6]\n  mov  cx, numePointer\n  sub  cx, si\n  cld\n  rep movsb\n  mov  numePointer, di\n  dec  numes\n  jmp  bucla\n\n  ...\n\nBeware of this: after deletion of a name you will probably want to use lista again.

        "Question": "I am trying to Sort the array by the second row. For n1, I use two square brackets [][] whereas for n2 I use a single square bracket [,]. I am trying to understand why do I get different results?\nThank you in advance.\nimport numpy\n\nsampleArray = numpy.array([[34, 43, 73], [82, 22, 12], [53, 94, 66]])\n\nprint(sampleArray)\n\nn1= sampleArray[:][sampleArray[1,:].argsort()]\nn2 = sampleArray[:,sampleArray[1,:].argsort()]\nprint(n1)\nprint(n2)\n\n",
        "Answer": "At the interpreter level, you are doing the following:\nsomeindex = sampleArray[1, :].argsort()\nn1 = sampleArray.__getitem__(slice(None)).__getitem__(someindex)\nn2 = sampleArray.__getitem__((slice(None), someindex))\n\nThe first call to __getitem__(slice(None)) in n1 is effectively a no-op: it just returns a view of the entire original array. The fact that it's technically a separate object won't affect the subsequent read. So n1 is an application of someindex along the rows.\nFor n2, you pass in a tuple of indices (remember that it's commas that make a tuple, not parentheses). When given a tuple as the argument to __getitem__, numpy arrays split the elements along the leading dimensions. In this case, slice(None) selects all rows, while someindex applies along the different columns.\nMoral of the story: multidimensional numpy indices are not separable into a series of list-like indices. This is especially important for assignments: x[a, b] = c is x.__setitem__((a, b), c), while x[a][b] = c is x.__getitem__(a).__setitem__(b, c). The first case does what you generally expect, and modifies x, but can be difficult to construct, e.g., if a is a mask. The second case is often easier to construct indices for, but creates a temporary object that does not write back to the original array. Stack Overflow has its share of questions about this variant of the scenario.\n",

        "Answer": "Why your for loop does not work:\nfor (int columnIndex = 0; columnIndex <= 6; columnIndex++)\n{\n  if (game[i, columnIndex + 2] != 0)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n}\n\nThis loop does not take j into account.  It is testing for previous numbers added, as soon as one previous number fails this test, it will fail indefinitely.  This creates an infinite loop. This loop also fails if a number is placed in any position past 1, while it needs to fill 5 positions to succeed. This is mathematically impossible.\nThis:\n'should not have more the two empty cells or it cannot have more then two cells' is also mathematically impossible. a row of 9 cannot have less than 2 full and less than 2 empty at the same time.\nI think you are after 2 empty or full consecutively in a row.  For that testing for two empty in a row cannot be achieved as it starts empty, and you are testing it before you fill it.

        "Answer": "There are multiple options how you can deal with this one:\nServer pre-processing\nTrim the data on the server and send to client only set you would like to render. The advantage is the client's browser does not have to deal with large amount of data (and download them). Or introduce a \"totalIndex\" on each user that is incremental and continuous over organisations.\nAngular trimming - equal number of items in sub-collections\nIf your items in your sub-collections contain the same number of items. You have to multiply the indexes and check whether you already output 20 rows. If so use *ngIf to avoid showing more of them. When using *ngIf item is not rendered at all.\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n    <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n        <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n            <div *ngIf=\"(organisationIndex * organisation.departments.length) + (departmentIndex * department.users.length) + userIndex < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n            </div>\n        </ng-container>\n    </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nAngular trimming - counterpipe\nIf number of items in sub-collections is not equal use counterpipe.\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Counter } from './counter';\n\nconst counters = new WeakMap<any, Counter>();\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'counterPipe'\n})\nexport class CounterPipe implements PipeTransform  {\n  transform(value: any): Counter {\n    if (!counters.has(value)) {\n      counters.set(value, new Counter());\n    }\n    return counters.get(value);\n  }\n}\n\nThis will add counter while processing entities in *ngFor so you always know the number of element you are rendering.\nWrap your code with this pipe:\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let counter of [organisations | counterPipe]\">\n  <ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n      <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n          <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n              <div *ngIf=\"counter.inc() < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n              </div>\n          </ng-container>\n      </ng-container>\n  </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nExample of usage can be seen on https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nested-ngfor-ydvxjv\n",

The. gist of it is making a new array (IntStream.range) that contains every element of the given array but the one at currentIndex (.filter().map()) and then multiply the elements (reduce(... subTotal * current)).

        "Question": "So i have a column of data which consists of numbers where i have to find 5 instances of the same number.\nSo ,for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,5,6,4,7,,6,2,3, etc. In this 8 has occurred 9 times. So i want to increment the count only once because even though there are nine 8's what my code is doing is taking the first 8 and getting the 5 consecutive numbers are incrementing. Then it takes the next 8 and increments the count and so on where the count becomes 5 but i want it to be 1. What i want is the first occurrence of any number to be the base value and take 5 consecutive numbers and increment the count. Then then take the 6th 8 and count if there are 5 consecutive 8's or that specific number or not. So, for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,2,2,5,4,3,6,7,9,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1.

It would be greatly appreciated :).\nExtra Elaboration\nSo the first one only has 5 consecutive 8's in the manner i specified. Hence the first one will have an output count =1 . In the second one, there are 4 of the 5 consecutive numbers of the same starting number. Hence the output would be 4, Another example i can give is 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8(ten 8's),9,9,9,9,4,5,6,4,6,6,6,6,6. In this , the count should be 3 as it has 10 8's which increments the count to 2 and another 5 consecutive 6 which increments count one more time. Total count would be 3.\nNow the error is i can't jump the array index from a[i] to a[i+5]. So the first one only has 5 consecutive 8's in the manner i specified. Hence the first one will have an output count =1 . In the second one, there are 4 of the 5 consecutive numbers of the same starting number.

In this , the count should be 3 as it has 10 8's which increments the count to 2 and another 5 consecutive 6 which increments count one more time. Total count would be 3.

        "Title": "VHDL 2008: Index in external names containing generated instances",
        "Question": "For a testbench, I'm trying to use external names to read signals within a DUT. It is not desired to export these signals outside of the DUT, so I concluded that using external names was the best option here.\nUnfortunately, there are some for generate statements in the DUT, and this seems to make it quite difficult to assign signals outside of the DUT for some reason.\nOne of these generate systems will look like this:\n   gen_block : for i in 0 to gen_loops generate\n      entity_block : entity_name\n         port map(\n            signal_name          => signal_name\n         );\n   end generate;\n\nMy external name definition of the first generate can then be put in std_logic_vector signal alias_signal by doing this:\nalias_signal(0) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(0).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\n\nThis works correctly. However, due to the large value of gen_loops, I would like to assign the external std_logic signals into std_logic_vectors, with index corresponding to the associated generate index.\nThe first thing I tried was this, by just leaving the indexes out and defining the external name as an std_logic_vector.\nalias_signal <= <<DUT_name.gen_block.entity_block.signal_name : std_logic_vector>>\n\nThis is perfectly fine according to Sigasi, but once it's compiled in Questasim, I get this error for each line in which I do this:\n# ** Error: [location][line]: (vopt-1571) Index required for FOR GENERATE \"gen_block\".\n\nI assume this means that I have to use an index no matter what.\nThe next obvious step is to use a for loop with variable for_val to address every iteration of entity_block:\nfor for_val in 0 to gen_loops loop\n   alias_signal(for_val) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(for_val).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\nend loop;\n\nStrangely, this produces an error in Sigasi, claiming that it \"could not find a declaration corresponding to for_val\". Somehow, within the external name, the value of for_val is getting lost, and the definition in the external name is somehow isolated from the rest of the code. Mind you, writing a number instead of for_val allows everything to work just fine, but due to the large value for gen_loops, this is a rather arduous task.\nIs anyone able to see what I'm doing wrong?

        "Title": "Initializing arrays in VHDL: How exactly does it work?",
        "Question": "Consider the following VHDL code:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', others => '0');\n\nHere, the indices 7 and 6 are important: they indicate which elements should be 1, and from that, the compiler can derive which ones should be 0.\nQuestion 1\nIf I understand correctly, this can also be written as\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nNow I am wondering how exactly this works, and whether the indices still matter or only the difference between them.  The way I understand it, the expression (x downto y => z) creates an array with indices x downto y, whose elements are all equal to z (and have the same type).  But do these indices matter when arrays are concatenated?  I.e., could I also write any of the following:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (1 downto 0 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (99 downto 98 => '1') & (4 downto -1 => '0');\n\nOf course one could say that those statements, esp. the last one, aren't really clear, but my question is: Would they have the same result?  Or would they cause some kind or error?\nThe reason I am wondering about this is that you could also write\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := \"11\" & \"000000\";\n\nand the literal \"11\" doesn't have any range specified, so I'm not sure what exactly the type of this literal would be, but certainly not std_logic_vector(7 downto 6).\nQuestion 2\nFinally, I am wondering what is the difference between\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nand\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', 5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nBy this I mean: Is there any reason you would want/need to write the former (which seems more error-prone because it will give unexpected results if you e.g. swap the 2 aggregates) instead of the latter?  Or is it just a matter of taste?\n",
        "Answer": "\nLets start with literals. When you specify a literal, the default range is (type_index'low to type_index'low + len-1). The easiest way to see this is when specifying a constant, where the range is not required in the subtype:\n\nconstant SOME_CONSTANT : std_logic_vector := x\"00\";\n\nHere, if you check the range of SOME_CONSTANT, you'll see its (0 to 7). This is because std_logic_vector is declared as:\ntype std_ulogic_vector is array(natural range <>) of std_logic;\n\nThe 'low value of natural is 0, which is the start point.\nLets say you went a bit crazy, and this:\ntype my_crazy_array_t is array(std_logic range <>) of integer;\n\nand you declared a constant:\nconstant CRAZY : my_crazy_array_t := (0, 22);\n\nThe results are:\nCRAZY('U') = 0\nCRAZY('X') = 22\nCRAZY'left = 'U'\nCRAZY'right = 'X'\nCRAZY'low = 'U'\nCRAZY'high = 'X'\n\nBecause 'U' is the low value of std_logic, followed by 'X'.\nOn the other questions, it all works because VHDL is always context driven, and for arrays as long as the lengths match, the resulting arrays can always be mapped from 'left to 'right. In your examples the length is correct, and the subtype is know from the declaration, so mapping can occur as you specified.\nNOTE: (4 downto -1 => '0'); is illegal, because -1 is not a valid index value for a std_logic_vector, so you would get an error (probably from the & function because it cannot work out what type you meant, because it cannot be std_logic_vector).\n\nThe difference is that the first one is a concatenation of a 2 bit and 6 bit bit string, and the 2nd is a complete 8 bit bit string. Which you use will probably be a matter of style. But usually, for this, I would use literals eg: constant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := x\"C0\"; what you use and when may depend on what is clearest to the user(s).\n\n",

        "Title": "Does array.map() starts iterating from the 1st element throughout the array?",
        "Question": "Is n automatically set to represent array indexes starting from 0? What confuses me is that I usually set up for loops to define i as an index indicator. But here how does n do it without being set that way?\nx is an array\nfunction maps(x){\n  return x.map(\n    function (n) {\n      return n*2\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nI was trying to double each element of an array. And i actually figured it out but my question is \"how does it actually work?\".\n",
        "Answer": "The function (n) { return n*2 } is accepted as an argument of a callback function by the map() method. So function (n) { return n*2 } executes for each element in the array x and its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The parameter n represents the current element being processed in the array and the second parameter should be the index of the current element being processed in the array. For example, we can turn your code snippet as the following:\nlet arr = [30, 51, 76];\n\nfunction maps(x){ \n    return x.map( function (n, index) {\n        console.log(n + \" \" + index);\n        return n*2;\n    } ) \n}\n\nconsole.log(maps(arr));\n\nThen we should get the result:\n30 0\n51 1\n76 2\n[ 60, 102, 152 ]\n\nAnd we can see the indices that correspond to the elements.\nI think the best way to eliminate your confusion is to figure it out how the map() method is defined. Here, I cite a piece of code snippet from https://jsvault.com/array-map to show what exactly is a map() method:\n/**\n * The callback gets 3 arguments\n * the item, the index and the  execution context\n */\nArray.prototype.newMap = function (callback) {\n  const result = [];\n  for (let index = 0; index < this.length; index++) {\n    // This is primarily to check if the item\n    // exists in the array, \n    if (this.indexOf(this[index]) > -1) {\n      result[index] = callback(this[index], index, this)\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n\nWithin the definition, there is a for loop to handle a callback function, in which case, it could be your function (n) { return n*2 }.\nIf you want to know more details, please check the links https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\nand\nhttps://jsvault.com/array-map\n",

Apparantly your numes (names in the list) variable is word-sized and you would like to extend the byte-sized response from the user to a full word. mov al, al does not do that, you need mov ah, 0 (or cbw for these very small positive numbers).\nFor a solution consider this: although the user will work with indexes starting at 1, the program should be using 0 as the first index as it will simplify things a lot.\nsub  al, '0'     ; AL=[1,9]\ncbw              ; AX=[1,9]   1-based index\ndec  ax          ; AX=[0,8]   0-based index\ncmp  ax, numes   ; numes is [0,9]\njae  invalidIndex\n\n\nmov di, si\n\n\nYou are setting up for your shiftloop with identical pointers for the source and the destination! Any work the loop might do will not matter that way!\n\nmov si, numePointer\n\n\nYou are not using the numePointer the way I defined and used it in my previous answer(s).\nThis is a pointer that contains the address of the end of the list of names.\nelena$maria$daria$adria$\n^                       ^\nnume                    [numePointer]\n\n\nshiftLoop:\ncmp bx, 0\nje updatePointer\n\n\nYou are using the index in BX to control the number of iterations. Each of your iterations just moves a single byte where in fact you should be moving 6 bytes (5 + 1), so you're copying not nearly enough!\nSolution for sterge\nLet's assume there are 4 names on the list, so numes=4:\n1.elena\n2.maria\n3.daria\n4.adria\n\nValid user inputs would be 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the validation code will turn this into AL ranging from 0 to 3.\nMultiplying this number by 6 will give us the offset in the list where we find the name that is to be deleted. The part of the list that needs to be shifted down in memory then starts 6 bytes above that. It is possible for this part to be empty if the topmost item was selected for deletion. My code below uses the rep movsb instruction that will work fine even if there's nothing to copy.\n  ...\n\n  sub  al, 49      ; AL=[\"1\",\"9\"] 1-based input -> AL=[0,8] 0-based index\n  mov  ah, 6\n  mul  ah          ; -> AX = {0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48}\n  add  ax, offset nume\n  cmp  ax, numePointer\n  jnb  invalidIndex\n  mov  di, ax\n  lea  si, [di + 6]\n  mov  cx, numePointer\n  sub  cx, si\n  cld\n  rep movsb\n  mov  numePointer, di\n  dec  numes\n  jmp  bucla\n\n  ...\n\nBeware of this: after deletion of a name you will probably want to use lista again. Make sure you reset the numeIndex to \"1\". Otherwise my code from I have an indexing problems won't function as it should:\nlista:\n  mov  byte ptr [numeIndex + 2], \"1\"\n  ...\n\n",

The fact that it's technically a separate object won't affect the subsequent read. So n1 is an application of someindex along the rows.\nFor n2, you pass in a tuple of indices (remember that it's commas that make a tuple, not parentheses). When given a tuple as the argument to __getitem__, numpy arrays split the elements along the leading dimensions. In this case, slice(None) selects all rows, while someindex applies along the different columns.\nMoral of the story: multidimensional numpy indices are not separable into a series of list-like indices. This is especially important for assignments: x[a, b] = c is x.__setitem__((a, b), c), while x[a][b] = c is x.__getitem__(a).__setitem__(b, c). The first case does what you generally expect, and modifies x, but can be difficult to construct, e.g., if a is a mask. The second case is often easier to construct indices for, but creates a temporary object that does not write back to the original array.

        "Answer": "Why your for loop does not work:\nfor (int columnIndex = 0; columnIndex <= 6; columnIndex++)\n{\n  if (game[i, columnIndex + 2] != 0)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n}\n\nThis loop does not take j into account.  It is testing for previous numbers added, as soon as one previous number fails this test, it will fail indefinitely.  This creates an infinite loop. This loop also fails if a number is placed in any position past 1, while it needs to fill 5 positions to succeed. This is mathematically impossible.\nThis:\n'should not have more the two empty cells or it cannot have more then two cells' is also mathematically impossible. a row of 9 cannot have less than 2 full and less than 2 empty at the same time.\nI think you are after 2 empty or full consecutively in a row.  For that testing for two empty in a row cannot be achieved as it starts empty, and you are testing it before you fill it.  Fortunately this is a redundant test that will always be true based on all of the other test cases.\nNo more than 2 full in a row is possible, but can also lead to impossible scenarios.  I have added a check that resets the scenario if it has not found the solution after 1000 guesses.\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        public static void Main(String[] args)\n        {\n            for (int times = 0; times < 2; times++)\n            {\n                startGame();\n                // Console.WriteLine(\"******************************************************************\");\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        private static void startGame()\n        {\n            int iCount = 0;\n            int[,] game = new int[3, 9];\n            int occupancyLimit = 15;\n\n            while (occupancyLimit > 0)\n            {\n                int i = getRandomNumber(3);\n                int j = getRandomNumber(9);\n                //Console.Write(i);\n                //Console.Write(j);\n                // Console.Write(game[i,j]+\" \");\n                int data = validateAndReturnNumber(i, j, game);\n\n                if (data > 0)\n                {\n                    game[i, j] = data;\n                    occupancyLimit--;\n                    //Console.WriteLine(game[i,j]);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    iCount++;\n                    //Console.WriteLine(iCount);\n                    //printGame(game);\n\n                    // If X many fails, retry\n                    if(iCount > 1000)\n                    {\n                        iCount = 0;\n                        game = new int[3, 9];\n                        occupancyLimit = 15;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // If you want to check for zeros you would need to do it here.

        "Answer": "There are multiple options how you can deal with this one:\nServer pre-processing\nTrim the data on the server and send to client only set you would like to render. The advantage is the client's browser does not have to deal with large amount of data (and download them). Or introduce a \"totalIndex\" on each user that is incremental and continuous over organisations.\nAngular trimming - equal number of items in sub-collections\nIf your items in your sub-collections contain the same number of items. You have to multiply the indexes and check whether you already output 20 rows. If so use *ngIf to avoid showing more of them. When using *ngIf item is not rendered at all.\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n    <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n        <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n            <div *ngIf=\"(organisationIndex * organisation.departments.length) + (departmentIndex * department.users.length) + userIndex < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n            </div>\n        </ng-container>\n    </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nAngular trimming - counterpipe\nIf number of items in sub-collections is not equal use counterpipe.\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Counter } from './counter';\n\nconst counters = new WeakMap<any, Counter>();\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'counterPipe'\n})\nexport class CounterPipe implements PipeTransform  {\n  transform(value: any): Counter {\n    if (!counters.has(value)) {\n      counters.set(value, new Counter());\n    }\n    return counters.get(value);\n  }\n}\n\nThis will add counter while processing entities in *ngFor so you always know the number of element you are rendering.\nWrap your code with this pipe:\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let counter of [organisations | counterPipe]\">\n  <ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n      <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n          <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n              <div *ngIf=\"counter.inc() < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n              </div>\n          </ng-container>\n      </ng-container>\n  </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nExample of usage can be seen on https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nested-ngfor-ydvxjv\n",

What i want is the first occurrence of any number to be the base value and take 5 consecutive numbers and increment the count. Then then take the 6th 8 and count if there are 5 consecutive 8's or that specific number or not. So, for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,2,2,5,4,3,6,7,9,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1.

        "Title": "VHDL 2008: Index in external names containing generated instances",
        "Question": "For a testbench, I'm trying to use external names to read signals within a DUT. It is not desired to export these signals outside of the DUT, so I concluded that using external names was the best option here.\nUnfortunately, there are some for generate statements in the DUT, and this seems to make it quite difficult to assign signals outside of the DUT for some reason.\nOne of these generate systems will look like this:\n   gen_block : for i in 0 to gen_loops generate\n      entity_block : entity_name\n         port map(\n            signal_name          => signal_name\n         );\n   end generate;\n\nMy external name definition of the first generate can then be put in std_logic_vector signal alias_signal by doing this:\nalias_signal(0) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(0).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\n\nThis works correctly. However, due to the large value of gen_loops, I would like to assign the external std_logic signals into std_logic_vectors, with index corresponding to the associated generate index.\nThe first thing I tried was this, by just leaving the indexes out and defining the external name as an std_logic_vector.\nalias_signal <= <<DUT_name.gen_block.entity_block.signal_name : std_logic_vector>>\n\nThis is perfectly fine according to Sigasi, but once it's compiled in Questasim, I get this error for each line in which I do this:\n# ** Error: [location][line]: (vopt-1571) Index required for FOR GENERATE \"gen_block\".\n\nI assume this means that I have to use an index no matter what.\nThe next obvious step is to use a for loop with variable for_val to address every iteration of entity_block:\nfor for_val in 0 to gen_loops loop\n   alias_signal(for_val) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(for_val).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\nend loop;\n\nStrangely, this produces an error in Sigasi, claiming that it \"could not find a declaration corresponding to for_val\". Somehow, within the external name, the value of for_val is getting lost, and the definition in the external name is somehow isolated from the rest of the code. Mind you, writing a number instead of for_val allows everything to work just fine, but due to the large value for gen_loops, this is a rather arduous task.\nIs anyone able to see what I'm doing wrong? Do you maybe have a suggestion for a better method than this one? Is Sigasi being dumb, or is it me?

        "Title": "Initializing arrays in VHDL: How exactly does it work?",
        "Question": "Consider the following VHDL code:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', others => '0');\n\nHere, the indices 7 and 6 are important: they indicate which elements should be 1, and from that, the compiler can derive which ones should be 0.\nQuestion 1\nIf I understand correctly, this can also be written as\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nNow I am wondering how exactly this works, and whether the indices still matter or only the difference between them.  The way I understand it, the expression (x downto y => z) creates an array with indices x downto y, whose elements are all equal to z (and have the same type).  But do these indices matter when arrays are concatenated?  I.e., could I also write any of the following:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (1 downto 0 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (99 downto 98 => '1') & (4 downto -1 => '0');\n\nOf course one could say that those statements, esp. the last one, aren't really clear, but my question is: Would they have the same result?  Or would they cause some kind or error?\nThe reason I am wondering about this is that you could also write\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := \"11\" & \"000000\";\n\nand the literal \"11\" doesn't have any range specified, so I'm not sure what exactly the type of this literal would be, but certainly not std_logic_vector(7 downto 6).\nQuestion 2\nFinally, I am wondering what is the difference between\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nand\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', 5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nBy this I mean: Is there any reason you would want/need to write the former (which seems more error-prone because it will give unexpected results if you e.g. swap the 2 aggregates) instead of the latter?  Or is it just a matter of taste?\n",
        "Answer": "\nLets start with literals. When you specify a literal, the default range is (type_index'low to type_index'low + len-1). The easiest way to see this is when specifying a constant, where the range is not required in the subtype:\n\nconstant SOME_CONSTANT : std_logic_vector := x\"00\";\n\nHere, if you check the range of SOME_CONSTANT, you'll see its (0 to 7). This is because std_logic_vector is declared as:\ntype std_ulogic_vector is array(natural range <>) of std_logic;\n\nThe 'low value of natural is 0, which is the start point.\nLets say you went a bit crazy, and this:\ntype my_crazy_array_t is array(std_logic range <>) of integer;\n\nand you declared a constant:\nconstant CRAZY : my_crazy_array_t := (0, 22);\n\nThe results are:\nCRAZY('U') = 0\nCRAZY('X') = 22\nCRAZY'left = 'U'\nCRAZY'right = 'X'\nCRAZY'low = 'U'\nCRAZY'high = 'X'\n\nBecause 'U' is the low value of std_logic, followed by 'X'.\nOn the other questions, it all works because VHDL is always context driven, and for arrays as long as the lengths match, the resulting arrays can always be mapped from 'left to 'right. In your examples the length is correct, and the subtype is know from the declaration, so mapping can occur as you specified.\nNOTE: (4 downto -1 => '0'); is illegal, because -1 is not a valid index value for a std_logic_vector, so you would get an error (probably from the & function because it cannot work out what type you meant, because it cannot be std_logic_vector).\n\nThe difference is that the first one is a concatenation of a 2 bit and 6 bit bit string, and the 2nd is a complete 8 bit bit string. Which you use will probably be a matter of style. But usually, for this, I would use literals eg: constant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := x\"C0\"; what you use and when may depend on what is clearest to the user(s).\n\n",

        "Question": "Is n automatically set to represent array indexes starting from 0? What confuses me is that I usually set up for loops to define i as an index indicator. But here how does n do it without being set that way?\nx is an array\nfunction maps(x){\n  return x.map(\n    function (n) {\n      return n*2\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nI was trying to double each element of an array. And i actually figured it out but my question is \"how does it actually work?\".\n",
        "Answer": "The function (n) { return n*2 } is accepted as an argument of a callback function by the map() method. So function (n) { return n*2 } executes for each element in the array x and its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The parameter n represents the current element being processed in the array and the second parameter should be the index of the current element being processed in the array. For example, we can turn your code snippet as the following:\nlet arr = [30, 51, 76];\n\nfunction maps(x){ \n    return x.map( function (n, index) {\n        console.log(n + \" \" + index);\n        return n*2;\n    } ) \n}\n\nconsole.log(maps(arr));\n\nThen we should get the result:\n30 0\n51 1\n76 2\n[ 60, 102, 152 ]\n\nAnd we can see the indices that correspond to the elements.\nI think the best way to eliminate your confusion is to figure it out how the map() method is defined. Here, I cite a piece of code snippet from https://jsvault.com/array-map to show what exactly is a map() method:\n/**\n * The callback gets 3 arguments\n * the item, the index and the  execution context\n */\nArray.prototype.newMap = function (callback) {\n  const result = [];\n  for (let index = 0; index < this.length; index++) {\n    // This is primarily to check if the item\n    // exists in the array, \n    if (this.indexOf(this[index]) > -1) {\n      result[index] = callback(this[index], index, this)\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n\nWithin the definition, there is a for loop to handle a callback function, in which case, it could be your function (n) { return n*2 }.\nIf you want to know more details, please check the links https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\nand\nhttps://jsvault.com/array-map\n",

Apparantly your numes (names in the list) variable is word-sized and you would like to extend the byte-sized response from the user to a full word. mov al, al does not do that, you need mov ah, 0 (or cbw for these very small positive numbers).\nFor a solution consider this: although the user will work with indexes starting at 1, the program should be using 0 as the first index as it will simplify things a lot.\nsub  al, '0'     ; AL=[1,9]\ncbw              ; AX=[1,9]   1-based index\ndec  ax          ; AX=[0,8]   0-based index\ncmp  ax, numes   ; numes is [0,9]\njae  invalidIndex\n\n\nmov di, si\n\n\nYou are setting up for your shiftloop with identical pointers for the source and the destination!

Each of your iterations just moves a single byte where in fact you should be moving 6 bytes (5 + 1), so you're copying not nearly enough!\nSolution for sterge\nLet's assume there are 4 names on the list, so numes=4:\n1.elena\n2.maria\n3.daria\n4.adria\n\nValid user inputs would be 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the validation code will turn this into AL ranging from 0 to 3.\nMultiplying this number by 6 will give us the offset in the list where we find the name that is to be deleted. The part of the list that needs to be shifted down in memory then starts 6 bytes above that. It is possible for this part to be empty if the topmost item was selected for deletion.

        "Question": "I am trying to Sort the array by the second row. For n1, I use two square brackets [][] whereas for n2 I use a single square bracket [,]. I am trying to understand why do I get different results?\nThank you in advance.\nimport numpy\n\nsampleArray = numpy.array([[34, 43, 73], [82, 22, 12], [53, 94, 66]])\n\nprint(sampleArray)\n\nn1= sampleArray[:][sampleArray[1,:].argsort()]\nn2 = sampleArray[:,sampleArray[1,:].argsort()]\nprint(n1)\nprint(n2)\n\n",
        "Answer": "At the interpreter level, you are doing the following:\nsomeindex = sampleArray[1, :].argsort()\nn1 = sampleArray.__getitem__(slice(None)).__getitem__(someindex)\nn2 = sampleArray.__getitem__((slice(None), someindex))\n\nThe first call to __getitem__(slice(None)) in n1 is effectively a no-op: it just returns a view of the entire original array. The fact that it's technically a separate object won't affect the subsequent read. So n1 is an application of someindex along the rows.\nFor n2, you pass in a tuple of indices (remember that it's commas that make a tuple, not parentheses). When given a tuple as the argument to __getitem__, numpy arrays split the elements along the leading dimensions. In this case, slice(None) selects all rows, while someindex applies along the different columns.\nMoral of the story: multidimensional numpy indices are not separable into a series of list-like indices. This is especially important for assignments: x[a, b] = c is x.__setitem__((a, b), c), while x[a][b] = c is x.__getitem__(a).__setitem__(b, c). The first case does what you generally expect, and modifies x, but can be difficult to construct, e.g., if a is a mask. The second case is often easier to construct indices for, but creates a temporary object that does not write back to the original array. Stack Overflow has its share of questions about this variant of the scenario.\n",

        "Answer": "Why your for loop does not work:\nfor (int columnIndex = 0; columnIndex <= 6; columnIndex++)\n{\n  if (game[i, columnIndex + 2] != 0)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n}\n\nThis loop does not take j into account.  It is testing for previous numbers added, as soon as one previous number fails this test, it will fail indefinitely.  This creates an infinite loop. This loop also fails if a number is placed in any position past 1, while it needs to fill 5 positions to succeed. This is mathematically impossible.\nThis:\n'should not have more the two empty cells or it cannot have more then two cells' is also mathematically impossible. a row of 9 cannot have less than 2 full and less than 2 empty at the same time.\nI think you are after 2 empty or full consecutively in a row.  For that testing for two empty in a row cannot be achieved as it starts empty, and you are testing it before you fill it.

        "Answer": "There are multiple options how you can deal with this one:\nServer pre-processing\nTrim the data on the server and send to client only set you would like to render. The advantage is the client's browser does not have to deal with large amount of data (and download them). Or introduce a \"totalIndex\" on each user that is incremental and continuous over organisations.\nAngular trimming - equal number of items in sub-collections\nIf your items in your sub-collections contain the same number of items. You have to multiply the indexes and check whether you already output 20 rows. If so use *ngIf to avoid showing more of them. When using *ngIf item is not rendered at all.\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n    <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n        <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n            <div *ngIf=\"(organisationIndex * organisation.departments.length) + (departmentIndex * department.users.length) + userIndex < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n            </div>\n        </ng-container>\n    </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nAngular trimming - counterpipe\nIf number of items in sub-collections is not equal use counterpipe.\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Counter } from './counter';\n\nconst counters = new WeakMap<any, Counter>();\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'counterPipe'\n})\nexport class CounterPipe implements PipeTransform  {\n  transform(value: any): Counter {\n    if (!counters.has(value)) {\n      counters.set(value, new Counter());\n    }\n    return counters.get(value);\n  }\n}\n\nThis will add counter while processing entities in *ngFor so you always know the number of element you are rendering.\nWrap your code with this pipe:\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let counter of [organisations | counterPipe]\">\n  <ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n      <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n          <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n              <div *ngIf=\"counter.inc() < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n              </div>\n          </ng-container>\n      </ng-container>\n  </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nExample of usage can be seen on https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nested-ngfor-ydvxjv\n",

The. gist of it is making a new array (IntStream.range) that contains every element of the given array but the one at currentIndex (.filter().map()) and then multiply the elements (reduce(... subTotal * current)).

        "Question": "So i have a column of data which consists of numbers where i have to find 5 instances of the same number.\nSo ,for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,5,6,4,7,,6,2,3, etc. In this 8 has occurred 9 times. So i want to increment the count only once because even though there are nine 8's what my code is doing is taking the first 8 and getting the 5 consecutive numbers are incrementing. Then it takes the next 8 and increments the count and so on where the count becomes 5 but i want it to be 1. What i want is the first occurrence of any number to be the base value and take 5 consecutive numbers and increment the count. Then then take the 6th 8 and count if there are 5 consecutive 8's or that specific number or not. So, for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,2,2,5,4,3,6,7,9,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1.

It would be greatly appreciated :).\nExtra Elaboration\nSo the first one only has 5 consecutive 8's in the manner i specified. Hence the first one will have an output count =1 . In the second one, there are 4 of the 5 consecutive numbers of the same starting number. Hence the output would be 4, Another example i can give is 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8(ten 8's),9,9,9,9,4,5,6,4,6,6,6,6,6. In this , the count should be 3 as it has 10 8's which increments the count to 2 and another 5 consecutive 6 which increments count one more time. Total count would be 3.\nNow the error is i can't jump the array index from a[i] to a[i+5]. So the first one only has 5 consecutive 8's in the manner i specified. Hence the first one will have an output count =1 . In the second one, there are 4 of the 5 consecutive numbers of the same starting number.

In this , the count should be 3 as it has 10 8's which increments the count to 2 and another 5 consecutive 6 which increments count one more time. Total count would be 3.

        "Title": "VHDL 2008: Index in external names containing generated instances",
        "Question": "For a testbench, I'm trying to use external names to read signals within a DUT. It is not desired to export these signals outside of the DUT, so I concluded that using external names was the best option here.\nUnfortunately, there are some for generate statements in the DUT, and this seems to make it quite difficult to assign signals outside of the DUT for some reason.\nOne of these generate systems will look like this:\n   gen_block : for i in 0 to gen_loops generate\n      entity_block : entity_name\n         port map(\n            signal_name          => signal_name\n         );\n   end generate;\n\nMy external name definition of the first generate can then be put in std_logic_vector signal alias_signal by doing this:\nalias_signal(0) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(0).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\n\nThis works correctly. However, due to the large value of gen_loops, I would like to assign the external std_logic signals into std_logic_vectors, with index corresponding to the associated generate index.\nThe first thing I tried was this, by just leaving the indexes out and defining the external name as an std_logic_vector.\nalias_signal <= <<DUT_name.gen_block.entity_block.signal_name : std_logic_vector>>\n\nThis is perfectly fine according to Sigasi, but once it's compiled in Questasim, I get this error for each line in which I do this:\n# ** Error: [location][line]: (vopt-1571) Index required for FOR GENERATE \"gen_block\".\n\nI assume this means that I have to use an index no matter what.\nThe next obvious step is to use a for loop with variable for_val to address every iteration of entity_block:\nfor for_val in 0 to gen_loops loop\n   alias_signal(for_val) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(for_val).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\nend loop;\n\nStrangely, this produces an error in Sigasi, claiming that it \"could not find a declaration corresponding to for_val\". Somehow, within the external name, the value of for_val is getting lost, and the definition in the external name is somehow isolated from the rest of the code. Mind you, writing a number instead of for_val allows everything to work just fine, but due to the large value for gen_loops, this is a rather arduous task.\nIs anyone able to see what I'm doing wrong?

        "Title": "Initializing arrays in VHDL: How exactly does it work?",
        "Question": "Consider the following VHDL code:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', others => '0');\n\nHere, the indices 7 and 6 are important: they indicate which elements should be 1, and from that, the compiler can derive which ones should be 0.\nQuestion 1\nIf I understand correctly, this can also be written as\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nNow I am wondering how exactly this works, and whether the indices still matter or only the difference between them.  The way I understand it, the expression (x downto y => z) creates an array with indices x downto y, whose elements are all equal to z (and have the same type).  But do these indices matter when arrays are concatenated?  I.e., could I also write any of the following:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (1 downto 0 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (99 downto 98 => '1') & (4 downto -1 => '0');\n\nOf course one could say that those statements, esp. the last one, aren't really clear, but my question is: Would they have the same result?  Or would they cause some kind or error?\nThe reason I am wondering about this is that you could also write\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := \"11\" & \"000000\";\n\nand the literal \"11\" doesn't have any range specified, so I'm not sure what exactly the type of this literal would be, but certainly not std_logic_vector(7 downto 6).\nQuestion 2\nFinally, I am wondering what is the difference between\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nand\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', 5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nBy this I mean: Is there any reason you would want/need to write the former (which seems more error-prone because it will give unexpected results if you e.g. swap the 2 aggregates) instead of the latter?  Or is it just a matter of taste?\n",
        "Answer": "\nLets start with literals. When you specify a literal, the default range is (type_index'low to type_index'low + len-1). The easiest way to see this is when specifying a constant, where the range is not required in the subtype:\n\nconstant SOME_CONSTANT : std_logic_vector := x\"00\";\n\nHere, if you check the range of SOME_CONSTANT, you'll see its (0 to 7). This is because std_logic_vector is declared as:\ntype std_ulogic_vector is array(natural range <>) of std_logic;\n\nThe 'low value of natural is 0, which is the start point.\nLets say you went a bit crazy, and this:\ntype my_crazy_array_t is array(std_logic range <>) of integer;\n\nand you declared a constant:\nconstant CRAZY : my_crazy_array_t := (0, 22);\n\nThe results are:\nCRAZY('U') = 0\nCRAZY('X') = 22\nCRAZY'left = 'U'\nCRAZY'right = 'X'\nCRAZY'low = 'U'\nCRAZY'high = 'X'\n\nBecause 'U' is the low value of std_logic, followed by 'X'.\nOn the other questions, it all works because VHDL is always context driven, and for arrays as long as the lengths match, the resulting arrays can always be mapped from 'left to 'right. In your examples the length is correct, and the subtype is know from the declaration, so mapping can occur as you specified.\nNOTE: (4 downto -1 => '0'); is illegal, because -1 is not a valid index value for a std_logic_vector, so you would get an error (probably from the & function because it cannot work out what type you meant, because it cannot be std_logic_vector).\n\nThe difference is that the first one is a concatenation of a 2 bit and 6 bit bit string, and the 2nd is a complete 8 bit bit string. Which you use will probably be a matter of style. But usually, for this, I would use literals eg: constant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := x\"C0\"; what you use and when may depend on what is clearest to the user(s).\n\n",

        "Title": "Does array.map() starts iterating from the 1st element throughout the array?",
        "Question": "Is n automatically set to represent array indexes starting from 0? What confuses me is that I usually set up for loops to define i as an index indicator. But here how does n do it without being set that way?\nx is an array\nfunction maps(x){\n  return x.map(\n    function (n) {\n      return n*2\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nI was trying to double each element of an array. And i actually figured it out but my question is \"how does it actually work?\".\n",
        "Answer": "The function (n) { return n*2 } is accepted as an argument of a callback function by the map() method. So function (n) { return n*2 } executes for each element in the array x and its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The parameter n represents the current element being processed in the array and the second parameter should be the index of the current element being processed in the array. For example, we can turn your code snippet as the following:\nlet arr = [30, 51, 76];\n\nfunction maps(x){ \n    return x.map( function (n, index) {\n        console.log(n + \" \" + index);\n        return n*2;\n    } ) \n}\n\nconsole.log(maps(arr));\n\nThen we should get the result:\n30 0\n51 1\n76 2\n[ 60, 102, 152 ]\n\nAnd we can see the indices that correspond to the elements.\nI think the best way to eliminate your confusion is to figure it out how the map() method is defined. Here, I cite a piece of code snippet from https://jsvault.com/array-map to show what exactly is a map() method:\n/**\n * The callback gets 3 arguments\n * the item, the index and the  execution context\n */\nArray.prototype.newMap = function (callback) {\n  const result = [];\n  for (let index = 0; index < this.length; index++) {\n    // This is primarily to check if the item\n    // exists in the array, \n    if (this.indexOf(this[index]) > -1) {\n      result[index] = callback(this[index], index, this)\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n\nWithin the definition, there is a for loop to handle a callback function, in which case, it could be your function (n) { return n*2 }.\nIf you want to know more details, please check the links https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\nand\nhttps://jsvault.com/array-map\n",

Apparantly your numes (names in the list) variable is word-sized and you would like to extend the byte-sized response from the user to a full word. mov al, al does not do that, you need mov ah, 0 (or cbw for these very small positive numbers).\nFor a solution consider this: although the user will work with indexes starting at 1, the program should be using 0 as the first index as it will simplify things a lot.\nsub  al, '0'     ; AL=[1,9]\ncbw              ; AX=[1,9]   1-based index\ndec  ax          ; AX=[0,8]   0-based index\ncmp  ax, numes   ; numes is [0,9]\njae  invalidIndex\n\n\nmov di, si\n\n\nYou are setting up for your shiftloop with identical pointers for the source and the destination! Any work the loop might do will not matter that way!\n\nmov si, numePointer\n\n\nYou are not using the numePointer the way I defined and used it in my previous answer(s).\nThis is a pointer that contains the address of the end of the list of names.\nelena$maria$daria$adria$\n^                       ^\nnume                    [numePointer]\n\n\nshiftLoop:\ncmp bx, 0\nje updatePointer\n\n\nYou are using the index in BX to control the number of iterations. Each of your iterations just moves a single byte where in fact you should be moving 6 bytes (5 + 1), so you're copying not nearly enough!\nSolution for sterge\nLet's assume there are 4 names on the list, so numes=4:\n1.elena\n2.maria\n3.daria\n4.adria\n\nValid user inputs would be 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the validation code will turn this into AL ranging from 0 to 3.\nMultiplying this number by 6 will give us the offset in the list where we find the name that is to be deleted. The part of the list that needs to be shifted down in memory then starts 6 bytes above that. It is possible for this part to be empty if the topmost item was selected for deletion. My code below uses the rep movsb instruction that will work fine even if there's nothing to copy.\n  ...\n\n  sub  al, 49      ; AL=[\"1\",\"9\"] 1-based input -> AL=[0,8] 0-based index\n  mov  ah, 6\n  mul  ah          ; -> AX = {0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48}\n  add  ax, offset nume\n  cmp  ax, numePointer\n  jnb  invalidIndex\n  mov  di, ax\n  lea  si, [di + 6]\n  mov  cx, numePointer\n  sub  cx, si\n  cld\n  rep movsb\n  mov  numePointer, di\n  dec  numes\n  jmp  bucla\n\n  ...\n\nBeware of this: after deletion of a name you will probably want to use lista again. Make sure you reset the numeIndex to \"1\". Otherwise my code from I have an indexing problems won't function as it should:\nlista:\n  mov  byte ptr [numeIndex + 2], \"1\"\n  ...\n\n",

The fact that it's technically a separate object won't affect the subsequent read. So n1 is an application of someindex along the rows.\nFor n2, you pass in a tuple of indices (remember that it's commas that make a tuple, not parentheses). When given a tuple as the argument to __getitem__, numpy arrays split the elements along the leading dimensions. In this case, slice(None) selects all rows, while someindex applies along the different columns.\nMoral of the story: multidimensional numpy indices are not separable into a series of list-like indices. This is especially important for assignments: x[a, b] = c is x.__setitem__((a, b), c), while x[a][b] = c is x.__getitem__(a).__setitem__(b, c). The first case does what you generally expect, and modifies x, but can be difficult to construct, e.g., if a is a mask. The second case is often easier to construct indices for, but creates a temporary object that does not write back to the original array.

        "Answer": "Why your for loop does not work:\nfor (int columnIndex = 0; columnIndex <= 6; columnIndex++)\n{\n  if (game[i, columnIndex + 2] != 0)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n}\n\nThis loop does not take j into account.  It is testing for previous numbers added, as soon as one previous number fails this test, it will fail indefinitely.  This creates an infinite loop. This loop also fails if a number is placed in any position past 1, while it needs to fill 5 positions to succeed. This is mathematically impossible.\nThis:\n'should not have more the two empty cells or it cannot have more then two cells' is also mathematically impossible. a row of 9 cannot have less than 2 full and less than 2 empty at the same time.\nI think you are after 2 empty or full consecutively in a row.  For that testing for two empty in a row cannot be achieved as it starts empty, and you are testing it before you fill it.  Fortunately this is a redundant test that will always be true based on all of the other test cases.\nNo more than 2 full in a row is possible, but can also lead to impossible scenarios.  I have added a check that resets the scenario if it has not found the solution after 1000 guesses.\nusing System;\n\nnamespace HelloWorld\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        public static void Main(String[] args)\n        {\n            for (int times = 0; times < 2; times++)\n            {\n                startGame();\n                // Console.WriteLine(\"******************************************************************\");\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        private static void startGame()\n        {\n            int iCount = 0;\n            int[,] game = new int[3, 9];\n            int occupancyLimit = 15;\n\n            while (occupancyLimit > 0)\n            {\n                int i = getRandomNumber(3);\n                int j = getRandomNumber(9);\n                //Console.Write(i);\n                //Console.Write(j);\n                // Console.Write(game[i,j]+\" \");\n                int data = validateAndReturnNumber(i, j, game);\n\n                if (data > 0)\n                {\n                    game[i, j] = data;\n                    occupancyLimit--;\n                    //Console.WriteLine(game[i,j]);\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    iCount++;\n                    //Console.WriteLine(iCount);\n                    //printGame(game);\n\n                    // If X many fails, retry\n                    if(iCount > 1000)\n                    {\n                        iCount = 0;\n                        game = new int[3, 9];\n                        occupancyLimit = 15;\n                    }\n                }\n\n                // If you want to check for zeros you would need to do it here.

        "Answer": "There are multiple options how you can deal with this one:\nServer pre-processing\nTrim the data on the server and send to client only set you would like to render. The advantage is the client's browser does not have to deal with large amount of data (and download them). Or introduce a \"totalIndex\" on each user that is incremental and continuous over organisations.\nAngular trimming - equal number of items in sub-collections\nIf your items in your sub-collections contain the same number of items. You have to multiply the indexes and check whether you already output 20 rows. If so use *ngIf to avoid showing more of them. When using *ngIf item is not rendered at all.\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n    <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n        <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n            <div *ngIf=\"(organisationIndex * organisation.departments.length) + (departmentIndex * department.users.length) + userIndex < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n            </div>\n        </ng-container>\n    </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nAngular trimming - counterpipe\nIf number of items in sub-collections is not equal use counterpipe.\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Counter } from './counter';\n\nconst counters = new WeakMap<any, Counter>();\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'counterPipe'\n})\nexport class CounterPipe implements PipeTransform  {\n  transform(value: any): Counter {\n    if (!counters.has(value)) {\n      counters.set(value, new Counter());\n    }\n    return counters.get(value);\n  }\n}\n\nThis will add counter while processing entities in *ngFor so you always know the number of element you are rendering.\nWrap your code with this pipe:\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let counter of [organisations | counterPipe]\">\n  <ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n      <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n          <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n              <div *ngIf=\"counter.inc() < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n              </div>\n          </ng-container>\n      </ng-container>\n  </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nExample of usage can be seen on https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nested-ngfor-ydvxjv\n",

What i want is the first occurrence of any number to be the base value and take 5 consecutive numbers and increment the count. Then then take the 6th 8 and count if there are 5 consecutive 8's or that specific number or not. So, for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,2,2,5,4,3,6,7,9,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1.

        "Title": "VHDL 2008: Index in external names containing generated instances",
        "Question": "For a testbench, I'm trying to use external names to read signals within a DUT. It is not desired to export these signals outside of the DUT, so I concluded that using external names was the best option here.\nUnfortunately, there are some for generate statements in the DUT, and this seems to make it quite difficult to assign signals outside of the DUT for some reason.\nOne of these generate systems will look like this:\n   gen_block : for i in 0 to gen_loops generate\n      entity_block : entity_name\n         port map(\n            signal_name          => signal_name\n         );\n   end generate;\n\nMy external name definition of the first generate can then be put in std_logic_vector signal alias_signal by doing this:\nalias_signal(0) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(0).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\n\nThis works correctly. However, due to the large value of gen_loops, I would like to assign the external std_logic signals into std_logic_vectors, with index corresponding to the associated generate index.\nThe first thing I tried was this, by just leaving the indexes out and defining the external name as an std_logic_vector.\nalias_signal <= <<DUT_name.gen_block.entity_block.signal_name : std_logic_vector>>\n\nThis is perfectly fine according to Sigasi, but once it's compiled in Questasim, I get this error for each line in which I do this:\n# ** Error: [location][line]: (vopt-1571) Index required for FOR GENERATE \"gen_block\".\n\nI assume this means that I have to use an index no matter what.\nThe next obvious step is to use a for loop with variable for_val to address every iteration of entity_block:\nfor for_val in 0 to gen_loops loop\n   alias_signal(for_val) <= <<DUT_name.gen_block(for_val).entity_block.signal_name : std_logic>>\nend loop;\n\nStrangely, this produces an error in Sigasi, claiming that it \"could not find a declaration corresponding to for_val\". Somehow, within the external name, the value of for_val is getting lost, and the definition in the external name is somehow isolated from the rest of the code. Mind you, writing a number instead of for_val allows everything to work just fine, but due to the large value for gen_loops, this is a rather arduous task.\nIs anyone able to see what I'm doing wrong? Do you maybe have a suggestion for a better method than this one? Is Sigasi being dumb, or is it me?

        "Title": "Initializing arrays in VHDL: How exactly does it work?",
        "Question": "Consider the following VHDL code:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', others => '0');\n\nHere, the indices 7 and 6 are important: they indicate which elements should be 1, and from that, the compiler can derive which ones should be 0.\nQuestion 1\nIf I understand correctly, this can also be written as\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nNow I am wondering how exactly this works, and whether the indices still matter or only the difference between them.  The way I understand it, the expression (x downto y => z) creates an array with indices x downto y, whose elements are all equal to z (and have the same type).  But do these indices matter when arrays are concatenated?  I.e., could I also write any of the following:\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (1 downto 0 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (99 downto 98 => '1') & (4 downto -1 => '0');\n\nOf course one could say that those statements, esp. the last one, aren't really clear, but my question is: Would they have the same result?  Or would they cause some kind or error?\nThe reason I am wondering about this is that you could also write\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := \"11\" & \"000000\";\n\nand the literal \"11\" doesn't have any range specified, so I'm not sure what exactly the type of this literal would be, but certainly not std_logic_vector(7 downto 6).\nQuestion 2\nFinally, I am wondering what is the difference between\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1') & (5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nand\nconstant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := (7 downto 6 => '1', 5 downto 0 => '0');\n\nBy this I mean: Is there any reason you would want/need to write the former (which seems more error-prone because it will give unexpected results if you e.g. swap the 2 aggregates) instead of the latter?  Or is it just a matter of taste?\n",
        "Answer": "\nLets start with literals. When you specify a literal, the default range is (type_index'low to type_index'low + len-1). The easiest way to see this is when specifying a constant, where the range is not required in the subtype:\n\nconstant SOME_CONSTANT : std_logic_vector := x\"00\";\n\nHere, if you check the range of SOME_CONSTANT, you'll see its (0 to 7). This is because std_logic_vector is declared as:\ntype std_ulogic_vector is array(natural range <>) of std_logic;\n\nThe 'low value of natural is 0, which is the start point.\nLets say you went a bit crazy, and this:\ntype my_crazy_array_t is array(std_logic range <>) of integer;\n\nand you declared a constant:\nconstant CRAZY : my_crazy_array_t := (0, 22);\n\nThe results are:\nCRAZY('U') = 0\nCRAZY('X') = 22\nCRAZY'left = 'U'\nCRAZY'right = 'X'\nCRAZY'low = 'U'\nCRAZY'high = 'X'\n\nBecause 'U' is the low value of std_logic, followed by 'X'.\nOn the other questions, it all works because VHDL is always context driven, and for arrays as long as the lengths match, the resulting arrays can always be mapped from 'left to 'right. In your examples the length is correct, and the subtype is know from the declaration, so mapping can occur as you specified.\nNOTE: (4 downto -1 => '0'); is illegal, because -1 is not a valid index value for a std_logic_vector, so you would get an error (probably from the & function because it cannot work out what type you meant, because it cannot be std_logic_vector).\n\nThe difference is that the first one is a concatenation of a 2 bit and 6 bit bit string, and the 2nd is a complete 8 bit bit string. Which you use will probably be a matter of style. But usually, for this, I would use literals eg: constant c : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0) := x\"C0\"; what you use and when may depend on what is clearest to the user(s).\n\n",

        "Question": "Is n automatically set to represent array indexes starting from 0? What confuses me is that I usually set up for loops to define i as an index indicator. But here how does n do it without being set that way?\nx is an array\nfunction maps(x){\n  return x.map(\n    function (n) {\n      return n*2\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nI was trying to double each element of an array. And i actually figured it out but my question is \"how does it actually work?\".\n",
        "Answer": "The function (n) { return n*2 } is accepted as an argument of a callback function by the map() method. So function (n) { return n*2 } executes for each element in the array x and its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The parameter n represents the current element being processed in the array and the second parameter should be the index of the current element being processed in the array. For example, we can turn your code snippet as the following:\nlet arr = [30, 51, 76];\n\nfunction maps(x){ \n    return x.map( function (n, index) {\n        console.log(n + \" \" + index);\n        return n*2;\n    } ) \n}\n\nconsole.log(maps(arr));\n\nThen we should get the result:\n30 0\n51 1\n76 2\n[ 60, 102, 152 ]\n\nAnd we can see the indices that correspond to the elements.\nI think the best way to eliminate your confusion is to figure it out how the map() method is defined. Here, I cite a piece of code snippet from https://jsvault.com/array-map to show what exactly is a map() method:\n/**\n * The callback gets 3 arguments\n * the item, the index and the  execution context\n */\nArray.prototype.newMap = function (callback) {\n  const result = [];\n  for (let index = 0; index < this.length; index++) {\n    // This is primarily to check if the item\n    // exists in the array, \n    if (this.indexOf(this[index]) > -1) {\n      result[index] = callback(this[index], index, this)\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n\nWithin the definition, there is a for loop to handle a callback function, in which case, it could be your function (n) { return n*2 }.\nIf you want to know more details, please check the links https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map\nand\nhttps://jsvault.com/array-map\n",

Apparantly your numes (names in the list) variable is word-sized and you would like to extend the byte-sized response from the user to a full word. mov al, al does not do that, you need mov ah, 0 (or cbw for these very small positive numbers).\nFor a solution consider this: although the user will work with indexes starting at 1, the program should be using 0 as the first index as it will simplify things a lot.\nsub  al, '0'     ; AL=[1,9]\ncbw              ; AX=[1,9]   1-based index\ndec  ax          ; AX=[0,8]   0-based index\ncmp  ax, numes   ; numes is [0,9]\njae  invalidIndex\n\n\nmov di, si\n\n\nYou are setting up for your shiftloop with identical pointers for the source and the destination!

Each of your iterations just moves a single byte where in fact you should be moving 6 bytes (5 + 1), so you're copying not nearly enough!\nSolution for sterge\nLet's assume there are 4 names on the list, so numes=4:\n1.elena\n2.maria\n3.daria\n4.adria\n\nValid user inputs would be 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the validation code will turn this into AL ranging from 0 to 3.\nMultiplying this number by 6 will give us the offset in the list where we find the name that is to be deleted. The part of the list that needs to be shifted down in memory then starts 6 bytes above that. It is possible for this part to be empty if the topmost item was selected for deletion.

        "Question": "I am trying to Sort the array by the second row. For n1, I use two square brackets [][] whereas for n2 I use a single square bracket [,]. I am trying to understand why do I get different results?\nThank you in advance.\nimport numpy\n\nsampleArray = numpy.array([[34, 43, 73], [82, 22, 12], [53, 94, 66]])\n\nprint(sampleArray)\n\nn1= sampleArray[:][sampleArray[1,:].argsort()]\nn2 = sampleArray[:,sampleArray[1,:].argsort()]\nprint(n1)\nprint(n2)\n\n",
        "Answer": "At the interpreter level, you are doing the following:\nsomeindex = sampleArray[1, :].argsort()\nn1 = sampleArray.__getitem__(slice(None)).__getitem__(someindex)\nn2 = sampleArray.__getitem__((slice(None), someindex))\n\nThe first call to __getitem__(slice(None)) in n1 is effectively a no-op: it just returns a view of the entire original array. The fact that it's technically a separate object won't affect the subsequent read. So n1 is an application of someindex along the rows.\nFor n2, you pass in a tuple of indices (remember that it's commas that make a tuple, not parentheses). When given a tuple as the argument to __getitem__, numpy arrays split the elements along the leading dimensions. In this case, slice(None) selects all rows, while someindex applies along the different columns.\nMoral of the story: multidimensional numpy indices are not separable into a series of list-like indices. This is especially important for assignments: x[a, b] = c is x.__setitem__((a, b), c), while x[a][b] = c is x.__getitem__(a).__setitem__(b, c). The first case does what you generally expect, and modifies x, but can be difficult to construct, e.g., if a is a mask. The second case is often easier to construct indices for, but creates a temporary object that does not write back to the original array. Stack Overflow has its share of questions about this variant of the scenario.\n",

        "Answer": "Why your for loop does not work:\nfor (int columnIndex = 0; columnIndex <= 6; columnIndex++)\n{\n  if (game[i, columnIndex + 2] != 0)\n  {\n    return -1;\n  }\n}\n\nThis loop does not take j into account.  It is testing for previous numbers added, as soon as one previous number fails this test, it will fail indefinitely.  This creates an infinite loop. This loop also fails if a number is placed in any position past 1, while it needs to fill 5 positions to succeed. This is mathematically impossible.\nThis:\n'should not have more the two empty cells or it cannot have more then two cells' is also mathematically impossible. a row of 9 cannot have less than 2 full and less than 2 empty at the same time.\nI think you are after 2 empty or full consecutively in a row.  For that testing for two empty in a row cannot be achieved as it starts empty, and you are testing it before you fill it.

        "Answer": "There are multiple options how you can deal with this one:\nServer pre-processing\nTrim the data on the server and send to client only set you would like to render. The advantage is the client's browser does not have to deal with large amount of data (and download them). Or introduce a \"totalIndex\" on each user that is incremental and continuous over organisations.\nAngular trimming - equal number of items in sub-collections\nIf your items in your sub-collections contain the same number of items. You have to multiply the indexes and check whether you already output 20 rows. If so use *ngIf to avoid showing more of them. When using *ngIf item is not rendered at all.\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n    <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n        <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n            <div *ngIf=\"(organisationIndex * organisation.departments.length) + (departmentIndex * department.users.length) + userIndex < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n            </div>\n        </ng-container>\n    </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nAngular trimming - counterpipe\nIf number of items in sub-collections is not equal use counterpipe.\nimport { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Counter } from './counter';\n\nconst counters = new WeakMap<any, Counter>();\n\n@Pipe({\n  name: 'counterPipe'\n})\nexport class CounterPipe implements PipeTransform  {\n  transform(value: any): Counter {\n    if (!counters.has(value)) {\n      counters.set(value, new Counter());\n    }\n    return counters.get(value);\n  }\n}\n\nThis will add counter while processing entities in *ngFor so you always know the number of element you are rendering.\nWrap your code with this pipe:\n<ng-container *ngFor=\"let counter of [organisations | counterPipe]\">\n  <ng-container *ngFor=\"let organisation of organisations; let organisationIndex = index;\">\n      <ng-container *ngFor=\"let department of organisation.departments; let departmentIndex = index;\">\n          <ng-container *ngFor=\"let user of department.users; let userIndex = index;\">\n              <div *ngIf=\"counter.inc() < 20\">\n                This is a List entry and i only want this 20 times\n              </div>\n          </ng-container>\n      </ng-container>\n  </ng-container>\n</ng-container>\n\nExample of usage can be seen on https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-nested-ngfor-ydvxjv\n",

The. gist of it is making a new array (IntStream.range) that contains every element of the given array but the one at currentIndex (.filter().map()) and then multiply the elements (reduce(... subTotal * current)).

        "Title": "How to make a +5 (or any +number) jump in array values inside a for loop?",
        "Question": "So i have a column of data which consists of numbers where i have to find 5 instances of the same number.\nSo ,for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,5,6,4,7,,6,2,3, etc. In this 8 has occurred 9 times. So i want to increment the count only once because even though there are nine 8's what my code is doing is taking the first 8 and getting the 5 consecutive numbers are incrementing. Then it takes the next 8 and increments the count and so on where the count becomes 5 but i want it to be 1. What i want is the first occurrence of any number to be the base value and take 5 consecutive numbers and increment the count. Then then take the 6th 8 and count if there are 5 consecutive 8's or that specific number or not. So, for example, 8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,5,5,5,5,5,1,1,2,2,5,4,3,6,7,9,3,4,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1. In this the count should be 4.\n   **count=0;\ncount1=0;\nfor i=1:length(data)-4\nfor j=i+1:i+4\nif data(i)~=data(j)\ncount1=0;\nbreak;\nelse\ncount1=count1+1;\nend\nif count1==5    % line 0\ncount=count+1;\n%data(i,1)=data(i+5,1); //line 1   <=comment\n%data(i)=data(i+5);     //line 2   <=comment\nelse\ncontinue;\nend\nend**\n\nIf(count_consecutive==5){\ncount_main=count_main+1; ...\na[i]=a[i+5];// continue for the base value. It should skip all the numbers that were counted in the consecutive count one and take the next number as the base for counting the consecutive numbers}\n\nThe logic in any language would be fine as my error is in the logic\nThanks for any help. It would be greatly appreciated :).\nExtra Elaboration\nSo the first one only has 5 consecutive 8's in the manner i specified. Hence the first one will have an output count =1 . In the second one, there are 4 of the 5 consecutive numbers of the same starting number. Hence the output would be 4, Another example i can give is 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8(ten 8's),9,9,9,9,4,5,6,4,6,6,6,6,6. In this , the count should be 3 as it has 10 8's which increments the count to 2 and another 5 consecutive 6 which increments count one more time. Total count would be 3.\nNow the error is i can't jump the array index from a[i] to a[i+5]. So the first one only has 5 consecutive 8's in the manner i specified. Hence the first one will have an output count =1 . In the second one, there are 4 of the 5 consecutive numbers of the same starting number. Hence the output would be 4, Another example i can give is 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8(ten 8's),9,9,9,9,4,5,6,4,6,6,6,6,6. In this , the count should be 3 as it has 10 8's which increments the count to 2 and another 5 consecutive 6 which increments count one more time. Total count would be 3. My problem is that i'm not able to skip/jump the array index from  x to x+5 in the for loop when my condition gets satisfied.\n",

        "Answer": "The implication is that if only one session is returned, $response.userId and $response.sessionName are not one-element arrays but just strings - and indexing into strings returns characters (e.g., 'foo'[0] returns 'f').[1]\nYou can use @(), the array-subexpression operator to ensure that you're always dealing with arrays:\n$user = @($response.userId)[$x]\n$name = @($response.sessionName)[$x]\n\nIf the count of sessions can be large, the following performs better (because @(...) creates a (shallow) copy of an array[2], whereas an [array] cast uses an existing array as-is):\n$user = ([array] $response.userId)[$x]\n$name = ([array] $response.sessionName)[$x]\n\n\n[1] Note that, unlike in C#, the character returned is technically also a string ([string], System.String), not a [char] (System.Char) instance, because PowerShell itself doesn't use the [char] type.\n[2] In older PowerShell versions (up to v5.0), this also applied to arrays with explicitly enumerated elements; e.g., @('foo', 'bar'), but this case has since been optimized to accommodate the widespread practice of using such expressions to define array literals - even though the @(...) isn't strictly needed ('foo', 'bar' alone will do).\n",
