{"questionTitle": "How to return data from promise", "question": "<p>I need to get the <code>response.data</code> out of the promise so it can be returned by the enclosing function. I know, I probably can't do it the way I've coded it because of normal JavaScript scope. Is there any way, it can be done?</p>\n\n<p>The <em>console.log</em> at #1 produces the correct data. <em>console.log</em> #2 always produces 'a';</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function addSiteParentId(nodeId) {   \n    var theParentId = 'a';\n    var parentId = relationsManagerResource.GetParentId(nodeId)\n                        .then(function(response){                               \n                            theParentId = response.data;\n                            console.log(theParentId);  // #1\n                        });\n    console.log(theParentId);  // #2\n    return theParentId;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Any pointers would be appreciated.</p>\n", "acceptedAnswer": "<p>One of the fundamental principles behind a promise is that it's handled asynchronously. This means that you cannot create a promise and then immediately use its result synchronously in your code (e.g. it's not possible to return the result of a promise from within the function that initiated the promise).</p>\n<p>What you likely want to do instead is to <strong>return the entire promise itself.</strong> Then whatever function needs its result can call <code>.then()</code> on the promise, and the result will be there when the promise has been resolved.</p>\n<p>Here is a resource from HTML5Rocks that goes over the lifecycle of a promise, and how its output is resolved asynchronously:<br />\n<a href=\"https://web.dev/promises/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://web.dev/promises/</a></p>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37533929/how-to-return-data-from-promise"}
