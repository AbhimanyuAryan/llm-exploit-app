        "Title": "Why is clang-tidy giving me an uninitialized error for this c++ code?",
        "Question": "I don't understand why there is a problem with my code. I've made sure to initialize every value in my 2D array, so there shouldn't be an uninitialized value error anywhere!\nNote: I cannot use std::vector for this project. I'm also using different functions instead of std::min because I'm not allowed to import algorithm for this project.\nThis is the error reported by clang-tidy:\n\n2nd function call argument is an uninitialized value\n\nHere is my code (error only occurs on line 17):\nint** SeamCarver::CarvingSeamVertical() const {\n  int** energies = new int*[height_];\n  for (unsigned int row = 0; row < height_; row++) {\n    energies[row] = new int[width_];\n    for (unsigned int col = 0; col < width_; col++) {\n      energies[row][col] = 0; // initializes every value in the 2D array to zero\n    }\n  }\n  for (unsigned int col = 0; col < width_; col++) {\n    energies[height_ - 1][col] = this->GetEnergy(height_ - 1, (int)col);\n  }\n\n  for (int row = height_ - 2; row >= 0; row--) {\n    for (int col = 0; col < width_; col++) {\n      int best = 0;\n      if (col == 0) { //error occurs here v\n        best = FindMinTwo(energies[row + 1][col], energies[row + 1][col + 1]);\n      } else if (col == width_ - 1) {\n        best = FindMinTwo(energies[row + 1][col - 1], energies[row + 1][col]);\n      } else {\n        best = FindMinThree(energies[row + 1][col - 1],\n                            energies[row + 1][col],\n                            energies[row + 1][col + 1]);\n      }\n      energies[row][col] = this->GetEnergy(row, col) + best;\n    }\n  }\n  return energies;\n} // energies is properly deallocated by the function that uses it\n\nI've tried changing the ints to unsigned ints, but the error didn't go away. I also should not encounter out-of-bounds access errors, since row starts at height - 2 and the highest value of row accessed within the loop is height - 1.\nFor some reason, adding a statement which prints every value in the array makes the error go away.\n",
        "Answer": "clang-tidy doesn't make assumptions for you. For example, it doesn't assume that width_ is greater than 1. And indeed, if width_ == 1, you get a bunch of problems and clang-tidy warns about some of them.\nAdd assert(width_ > 1) at the beginning, and the error will go away. Or, if you are not willing to assert that, revise your algorithm to correctly handle the case of width_ <= 1.\n",

        "Title": "Is a blank try and catch IndexOutOfBoundsException valid at the end of a while loop of if statements in C#?",
        "Question": "I'm finishing an unfinished C# WinForms project, which is a save game editor for an unspecified game. I noticed that character portraits and icons' IDs have a valid range of 1 to 905, but there was no code to verify that the character ID is within that range, so I opted to fix it. I have an in-progress solution to this, with the code for it (with a lot of function names partially redacted) at the end of this post, and wanted to know if it would work. Visual Studio says there are no formatting errors, but I know that alone will not quite be enough. I cannot compile to test because I am not quite at a stage where the code is compilable, with a lot of missing WinForms data. If the specific exception that I placed would not be appropriate, what exception would best fit? If a while loop should not be used in this way, what method should I use that doesn't require rewriting the entire code block from scratch? Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

        "Title": "OutOfBoundsException when converting Java.awt.Polygon to a LibGDX polygon",
        "Question": "Introduction\nI have been attempting to draw filled polygons using LibGDX's ShapeRenderer by converting Java.awt.Polygon into float arrays, then passing these into the ShapeRenderer's polygon(float[]) method. I have noticed that for polygons with a large amount of npoints (in this case 4370), I keep getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException. This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Title": "My code for checking whether a number is a sublime number or not curiously fails for multiples of 12 (a sublime number itself). Does anyone know why?",
        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,... (so the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and I assume every multiple following that sequence afterwards). I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n. If both are true, then I have a sublime number on my hands, if either one or both are false, I don't.\nHere's the error for 12, which is a sublime number:\nsublime(12)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 12-element Vector{Int64} at index [14]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[78]:1\n\nFor comparison, here are the error messages for 24 and 48:\nsublime(24)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 24-element Vector{Int64} at index [30]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[80]:1\n\nsublime(48)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 48-element Vector{Int64} at index [62]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[82]:1\n\n\nI hope my information can provide some clues on to solving the current problem!\n",

        "Question": "I am getting IndexOutOfBoundsException when I remove items in mutableStateListOf, where MyType is some custom Type. There are almost around 250 items in myList. The items are removed in a loop. Almost 6 elements are visible in viewport at one time. When the item count reaches less than or equal to 6(with scroll position at top) then this exception is raised and the application crashes.\nFurthoremore, the application is crashed only when Listview is the active screen. Otherwise it doesnot crash/ this indexoutofboundexception is not raised. I have debugged the application logic and made sure that there are checks to ignore any update/add/remove request with index larger than list size. I suspect the exception is raised during recomposition only. Another behaviour I observed is when the List is scrolled to the bottom and the items are removed, then this exception is already raised at the very beginning of the loop.

        "Answer": "I believe the error has nothing to do with your harmonic numbers. Input values are the problem. If you look into the exception carefully you will see that it is thrown at the line where you extract the parameters from the command line arguments args[N]. For that is the only place where you operate with arrays in your code.\nTry this code:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    if (args.length != 2) {\n        System.out.println(\"The program requires 2 arguments.

        "Question": "In this code for quicksort, if input array is decreasing, for example 5 4 3 2 1 , variable i goes on incrementing without check and go out of array bound. Shouldn't that give segmentation error? As pointed out in replies, even if it doesnt give segmentation fault, why doesn't it swap arr[j] with garbage value in arr[i](where i is out of bounds)?\nint HoarePartition(int a[],int l,int r)\n{\n    int p,i,j,temp;\n    p=a[l],i=l,j=r+1;\n    do\n    {\n        do\n        {\n            i++;\n        }while(a[i]<p);\n        do\n        {\n            j--;\n        }while(a[j]>p);\n        temp=a[i];\n        a[i]=a[j];\n        a[j]=temp;\n    }while(i<j);\n    temp=a[i];\n    a[i]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    temp=a[l];\n    a[l]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    return j;\n}\n\nThis along with quicksort function gives correct sorted array for input array of 5 4 3 2 1 or similar decreasing array.\n",
        "Answer": "\nShouldn't that give segmentation error?\n\nNo. Segmentation faults are not specified to catch errors of going outside bounds of individual arrays or other objects within a process. They are specified, on operating systems that have them, to catch errors of accessing memory with incorrect permissions for the process, such as attempting to read outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to read, attempting to write outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to write, or attempting to execute instructions outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to execute.\nWhen a process has two arrays, a and b, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a into b will not generate a segmentation fault, because the process has permission to read b. When a process has an array a in the memory allocated (and mapped) for its stack, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a but is still within its stack space will not generate a segmentation fault.\n\nWhy does the code give correct output?\n\nImmediately after swapping a[i] and a[j] inside the do loop, the routine immediately swaps them back, reversing the change. This is because, once i is out of bounds, i<j is false, because j starts at r+1 and is decremented, so we know it is in bounds and hence is less than i. So the loop with while(i<j) terminates, and the code immediately after it, which swaps a[i] and a[j], is executed.\nSo, as long as no segment fault occurs, any swap with an element outside of the array is immediately reversed and has no lasting effect.\n",

        "Question": "I have a very simple SwiftUI app that shows a German word with its English translation. There is a \"Next\" button to cycle through a word list, which is swapped out for a \"Done\" button to restart the list if it is the last word.\nHere is the relevant code:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n  @State private var index = 0\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    let english = Word.words[index].english\n    let german = Word.words[index].german\n    \n    ZStack {\n      Color(\"BackgroundColor\")\n        .ignoresSafeArea()\n      VStack(spacing: 20) {\n        Spacer()\n        TitleView(word: german)\n        CaptionView(word: english)\n        Spacer()\n        if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n          Button {\n            index += 1\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Next Word\")\n          }\n        } else {\n          Button {\n            index = 0\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Done\")\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTapping repeatedly on \"Next\" and \"Done\" works as expected: the word list is iterated over and then reset to the beginning.\nHowever, when I tap quickly on these buttons, the app crashes with an Index out of range error. This happens when the \"Done\" button is displayed and tapped on. It also can occur when \"Done\" is not tapped on, but another area of the screen is tapped. As an example: I can alternate my taps between Button and TitleWord, and this will eventually cause the same crash. The only interactive components in the app are these two (conditional) buttons.\nWhat is causing the index to become out of range? It seems like I have introduced a race condition, but I don't know how.\n===\nUpdate:\nI fixed the problem with a simple check before incrementing index:\nif index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n  Button {\n    if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n      index += 1\n    }\n  } label: {\n    Text(\"Next Word\")\n  }\n} \n\nSince I am repeating the conditional, this tells me that there is indeed a race condition.\n",

        "Question": "On cppreference, I read the following about std::vector<T,Allocator>::operator[]:\n\nAccessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.\n\nDoes the standard draft contain a similar sentence? Or, what part of the standard should I deduce this thing from?\nI guess that if the standard says nothing about it, that would make it UB. But I haven't found anything about std::vector<T,Allocator>::at either, so...\n",
        "Answer": "It's specified in a very roundabout way.\nFirst, the members aren't specified for vector directly, but instead for the general Sequence. You can find the specification here: http://eel.is/c++draft/sequence.reqmts.\nFirst, the obvious part: at has the clause\n\nThrows: out_of_range if n >= a.size().\n\nSo this is where at's behavior comes from.\nAs for [], it says:\n\nReturns: *(a.begin() + n)\n\nSo the effect is the same as of that expression. We need to follow this to find the undefined behavior. For that we need to look at the iterator requirements.\nNow the C++20 requirements are nigh-unreadable, but the C++17 requirements are still there and do apply. So:\n\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#random.access.iterators-1 says that a + n (for some iterator a and a difference n) means doing tmp += n for a copy tmp of a.\nSame place says that r += n means repeated applications of ++r (or --r if n is negative).\nIn http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#tab:inputiterator we learn that ++r and *a both have the precondition that r or a respectively are dereferenceable. Note that violating a precondition means undefined behavior in C++ standardese.\n\nThis is where it gets really complicated. At this point we need to piece together the specifications of vector::begin and vector::end to understand that repeated incrementing of v.begin() will eventually (as in, after v.size() applications) yield v.end(), which is specified to be the past-the-end iterator. I cannot find the explicit statement that such iterators are not dereferenceable, but http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#general-7 specifies that the standard library assumes they are not, and in vector's case this is true.\nTherefore, v[v.size()] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size()), which is equivalent to *v.end(), which is undefined behavior.\nAnd v[v.size()+1] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size() + 1), which is equivalent to *std::next(v.end()), which is incrementing the past-the-end iterator and thus undefined behavior.\n",

        "Answer": "A number of people have already pointed out in the comments that your code currently has undefined behavior.\nAs far as ordering goes, you are guaranteed that as you've defined things right now x and y are in order--that is, y will have a higher memory address than x. But there could be padding in between them, so that there's less overlap than you expect, or possibly no overlap at all. In addition, the standard is written to allow (but not require) that array indices can be checked for validity, so even if they're immediately next to each other, the compiler is allowed to check that since you defined x to have 10 elements, any attempt at indexing beyond the 10th element will fail (e.g., cause a hardware interrupt or fault).\nThat leaves the question about how to get the result you apparently want, but with defined behavior. You have a couple of choices. One is to allocate a single array, and add an alias that allows you to treat half of it as if it were a separate array:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[20];\n    double *y = &x[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe other direction you could go would be to keep the two arrays separate, but then add a small proxy to allow addressing into both arrays as if they were one:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass proxy {\n    double *x_;\n    size_t N;\n    double *y_;\npublic:\n    template <class T, std::size_t N>\n    proxy(T (&x_)[N], T *y) : x_(x_), N(N), y_(y) {}\n\n    double &operator[](std::size_t n) {\n        if (n < N)\n            return x_[n];\n        else\n            return y_[n-N];\n    }\n};\n\nclass A{\n    double x_[10];\npublic:\n    double y[10];\n    proxy x{x_, y};\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nUnless you really need to use separate arrays for the two items, the first is probably preferable \u2013 it's clearly simpler and probably faster.\n",

room database and the list is notified through a combination of liveData and viewModel), the app crashes with this error message:\nFATAL EXCEPTION: main\n    Process: com.jakrta.solo, PID: 8708\n

        "Answer": "You can simplify your Adapter by using ListAdapter. It will manage updating the list and animate any changed (see also DiffCallback for better update handling).\nListAdapter supports your approach with data changes via LiveData. When a new data set is submitted you just call adapter.submitList(dataList) to update the adapter.\n",

What am I doing wrong?\nHere is a screenshot for reference:\n\n",
        "Answer": "The StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is an unchecked exception that occurs when an attempt is made to access the character of a string at an index which is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\n\nThrown by String methods to indicate that an index is either negative or greater than the size of the string. For some methods such as the charAt method, this exception also is thrown when the index is equal to the size of the string.\n\nSo something somewhere is trying to access a character at an index that is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\nIf we look at the stacktrace we can see that the exception is thrown from the Color.parseColor method:\n// TIP: Length of 0 means an empty string!\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0; index=0\n  at java.lang.String.charAt(Native Method)\n  at android.graphics.Color.parseColor(Color.java:1384)\n  // The stack trace is guiding us to line 33!\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:33)\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:15)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7065)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.bindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7107)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler.tryBindViewHolderByDeadline (RecyclerView.java:6012)\n\nTherefore, Color.parseColor is getting an empty (\"\") String as an argument, We can see color is coming from a collection named ListTheColorTone:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty String\n  \n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nWhat does this mean to us?\nThe ListTheColorTone collection is perhaps missing an element at the position that is passed. Or some other logic in your application is incorrect. As @Zabuzard advised, try printing the value of position (or perhaps the contents of the collection) to understand what's going wrong:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty string\n\n  println(\"position: $position\")\n  println(\"ListTheColorTone: ${ListTheColorTone.toList()}\")\n  println(\"color: $color\")\n\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nOr even better, try adding a breakpoint at the line where the exception is thrown and check the value of position and ListTheColorTone.size.

        "Answer": "String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \") + 1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n\nThis line is a problem when you name only has one space inside it (ex: \"John Doe\"). It will look for a substring between the index of the first space (4 in thsis case) in the name + 1 and the last space which is the same one! So in this case you are asking for a substring between 5 and the lesser 4 which will give an error.\nIf you can, I recommend the split method. This will work with multiple names:\nStringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(\" \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + \". \");\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n\n",

        "Title": "Is a blank try and catch IndexOutOfBoundsException valid at the end of a while loop of if statements in C#?",
        "Question": "I'm finishing an unfinished C# WinForms project, which is a save game editor for an unspecified game. I noticed that character portraits and icons' IDs have a valid range of 1 to 905, but there was no code to verify that the character ID is within that range, so I opted to fix it. I have an in-progress solution to this, with the code for it (with a lot of function names partially redacted) at the end of this post, and wanted to know if it would work. Visual Studio says there are no formatting errors, but I know that alone will not quite be enough. I cannot compile to test because I am not quite at a stage where the code is compilable, with a lot of missing WinForms data. If the specific exception that I placed would not be appropriate, what exception would best fit? If a while loop should not be used in this way, what method should I use that doesn't require rewriting the entire code block from scratch? Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

        "Title": "OutOfBoundsException when converting Java.awt.Polygon to a LibGDX polygon",
        "Question": "Introduction\nI have been attempting to draw filled polygons using LibGDX's ShapeRenderer by converting Java.awt.Polygon into float arrays, then passing these into the ShapeRenderer's polygon(float[]) method. I have noticed that for polygons with a large amount of npoints (in this case 4370), I keep getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException. This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Title": "My code for checking whether a number is a sublime number or not curiously fails for multiples of 12 (a sublime number itself). Does anyone know why?",
        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,... (so the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and I assume every multiple following that sequence afterwards). I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n. If both are true, then I have a sublime number on my hands, if either one or both are false, I don't.\nHere's the error for 12, which is a sublime number:\nsublime(12)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 12-element Vector{Int64} at index [14]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[78]:1\n\nFor comparison, here are the error messages for 24 and 48:\nsublime(24)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 24-element Vector{Int64} at index [30]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[80]:1\n\nsublime(48)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 48-element Vector{Int64} at index [62]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[82]:1\n\n\nI hope my information can provide some clues on to solving the current problem!\n",

        "Question": "In this code for quicksort, if input array is decreasing, for example 5 4 3 2 1 , variable i goes on incrementing without check and go out of array bound. Shouldn't that give segmentation error?

        "Answer": "\nShouldn't that give segmentation error?\n\nNo. Segmentation faults are not specified to catch errors of going outside bounds of individual arrays or other objects within a process. They are specified, on operating systems that have them, to catch errors of accessing memory with incorrect permissions for the process, such as attempting to read outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to read, attempting to write outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to write, or attempting to execute instructions outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to execute.\nWhen a process has two arrays, a and b, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a into b will not generate a segmentation fault, because the process has permission to read b. When a process has an array a in the memory allocated (and mapped) for its stack, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a but is still within its stack space will not generate a segmentation fault.\n\nWhy does the code give correct output?\n\nImmediately after swapping a[i] and a[j] inside the do loop, the routine immediately swaps them back, reversing the change. This is because, once i is out of bounds, i<j is false, because j starts at r+1 and is decremented, so we know it is in bounds and hence is less than i. So the loop with while(i<j) terminates, and the code immediately after it, which swaps a[i] and a[j], is executed.\nSo, as long as no segment fault occurs, any swap with an element outside of the array is immediately reversed and has no lasting effect.\n",

        "Title": "Conditional button still executing action when false (not visible)",
        "Question": "I have a very simple SwiftUI app that shows a German word with its English translation. There is a \"Next\" button to cycle through a word list, which is swapped out for a \"Done\" button to restart the list if it is the last word.\nHere is the relevant code:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n  @State private var index = 0\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    let english = Word.words[index].english\n    let german = Word.words[index].german\n    \n    ZStack {\n      Color(\"BackgroundColor\")\n        .ignoresSafeArea()\n      VStack(spacing: 20) {\n        Spacer()\n        TitleView(word: german)\n        CaptionView(word: english)\n        Spacer()\n        if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n          Button {\n            index += 1\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Next Word\")\n          }\n        } else {\n          Button {\n            index = 0\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Done\")\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTapping repeatedly on \"Next\" and \"Done\" works as expected: the word list is iterated over and then reset to the beginning.\nHowever, when I tap quickly on these buttons, the app crashes with an Index out of range error. This happens when the \"Done\" button is displayed and tapped on. It also can occur when \"Done\" is not tapped on, but another area of the screen is tapped. As an example: I can alternate my taps between Button and TitleWord, and this will eventually cause the same crash. The only interactive components in the app are these two (conditional) buttons.\nWhat is causing the index to become out of range? It seems like I have introduced a race condition, but I don't know how.\n===\nUpdate:\nI fixed the problem with a simple check before incrementing index:\nif index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n  Button {\n    if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n      index += 1\n    }\n  } label: {\n    Text(\"Next Word\")\n  }\n} \n\nSince I am repeating the conditional, this tells me that there is indeed a race condition.\n",

        "Question": "On cppreference, I read the following about std::vector<T,Allocator>::operator[]:\n\nAccessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.\n\nDoes the standard draft contain a similar sentence? Or, what part of the standard should I deduce this thing from?\nI guess that if the standard says nothing about it, that would make it UB. But I haven't found anything about std::vector<T,Allocator>::at either, so...\n",
        "Answer": "It's specified in a very roundabout way.\nFirst, the members aren't specified for vector directly, but instead for the general Sequence. You can find the specification here: http://eel.is/c++draft/sequence.reqmts.\nFirst, the obvious part: at has the clause\n\nThrows: out_of_range if n >= a.size().\n\nSo this is where at's behavior comes from.\nAs for [], it says:\n\nReturns: *(a.begin() + n)\n\nSo the effect is the same as of that expression. We need to follow this to find the undefined behavior. For that we need to look at the iterator requirements.\nNow the C++20 requirements are nigh-unreadable, but the C++17 requirements are still there and do apply. So:\n\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#random.access.iterators-1 says that a + n (for some iterator a and a difference n) means doing tmp += n for a copy tmp of a.\nSame place says that r += n means repeated applications of ++r (or --r if n is negative).\nIn http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#tab:inputiterator we learn that ++r and *a both have the precondition that r or a respectively are dereferenceable. Note that violating a precondition means undefined behavior in C++ standardese.\n\nThis is where it gets really complicated. At this point we need to piece together the specifications of vector::begin and vector::end to understand that repeated incrementing of v.begin() will eventually (as in, after v.size() applications) yield v.end(), which is specified to be the past-the-end iterator. I cannot find the explicit statement that such iterators are not dereferenceable, but http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#general-7 specifies that the standard library assumes they are not, and in vector's case this is true.\nTherefore, v[v.size()] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size()), which is equivalent to *v.end(), which is undefined behavior.\nAnd v[v.size()+1] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size() + 1), which is equivalent to *std::next(v.end()), which is incrementing the past-the-end iterator and thus undefined behavior.\n",

So if the string is exactly 8 characters long then you will get that error.\nUpdate your if check to:\nif (self.txtQty.text.length > 8) {\n\nOr possibly your if check is correct and the range should be changed from {8,1}, to {7,1} to replace the 8th character.\nWhich of those two changes you make depends on your goal (to change the 8th or 9th character).\n\nTo help visualize the range, I'll attempt a bit of a drawing:\nSome string, its indexes, and range {8,1}:\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0   <-- The string\n| | | | | | | | | | |\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1  <-- Its indexes\n                    0\n                ***    <-- Area for {8,1}\n\nHere you can see that the range {8,1} is getting the 9th character.\n",

        "Title": "c++ stack order asserted?",
        "Question": "Is the following code under every compliant compiler optimization asserted to return the value 14? Is this recommendable to use? Is this more efficient than introducing two pointers onto a common array? Has the below stack technique a specific name? Which better practice yields the exact same binary upon compilation under reasonable or admirable assumptions?\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[10];\n    double y[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nWhere can I look up determinations like these? (links, references). I guess there is a trick to reading the standard efficiently.\n",
        "Answer": "A number of people have already pointed out in the comments that your code currently has undefined behavior.\nAs far as ordering goes, you are guaranteed that as you've defined things right now x and y are in order--that is, y will have a higher memory address than x. But there could be padding in between them, so that there's less overlap than you expect, or possibly no overlap at all. In addition, the standard is written to allow (but not require) that array indices can be checked for validity, so even if they're immediately next to each other, the compiler is allowed to check that since you defined x to have 10 elements, any attempt at indexing beyond the 10th element will fail (e.g., cause a hardware interrupt or fault).\nThat leaves the question about how to get the result you apparently want, but with defined behavior. You have a couple of choices. One is to allocate a single array, and add an alias that allows you to treat half of it as if it were a separate array:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[20];\n    double *y = &x[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe other direction you could go would be to keep the two arrays separate, but then add a small proxy to allow addressing into both arrays as if they were one:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass proxy {\n    double *x_;\n    size_t N;\n    double *y_;\npublic:\n    template <class T, std::size_t N>\n    proxy(T (&x_)[N], T *y) : x_(x_), N(N), y_(y) {}\n\n    double &operator[](std::size_t n) {\n        if (n < N)\n            return x_[n];\n        else\n            return y_[n-N];\n    }\n};\n\nclass A{\n    double x_[10];\npublic:\n    double y[10];\n    proxy x{x_, y};\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nUnless you really need to use separate arrays for the two items, the first is probably preferable \u2013 it's clearly simpler and probably faster.\n",

The variable must be able to be larger than the number of objects in the string array, so far I get \"IndexOutOfRangeException, which is to be expected.

        "Title": "StringIndexOutofBoundsException when trying to setBackgroundColor using a variable inside an Adapter, why?",
        "Question": "I have the following binding method:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!))\n}\n\nWhen invoked I get the following error:\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0; index=0\n  at java.lang.String.charAt(Native Method)\n  at android.graphics.Color.parseColor(Color.java:1384)\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:33)\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:15)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7065)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.bindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7107)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler.tryBindViewHolderByDeadline (RecyclerView.java:6012)\n\nThis doesn't happen when I manually insert the String inside the parseColor, for example parseColor(\"#ffffff\"); works just fine. What am I doing wrong?\nHere is a screenshot for reference:\n\n",
        "Answer": "The StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is an unchecked exception that occurs when an attempt is made to access the character of a string at an index which is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\n\nThrown by String methods to indicate that an index is either negative or greater than the size of the string. For some methods such as the charAt method, this exception also is thrown when the index is equal to the size of the string.\n\nSo something somewhere is trying to access a character at an index that is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\nIf we look at the stacktrace we can see that the exception is thrown from the Color.parseColor method:\n// TIP: Length of 0 means an empty string!\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0; index=0\n  at java.lang.String.charAt(Native Method)\n  at android.graphics.Color.parseColor(Color.java:1384)\n  // The stack trace is guiding us to line 33!\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:33)\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:15)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7065)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.bindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7107)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler.tryBindViewHolderByDeadline (RecyclerView.java:6012)\n\nTherefore, Color.parseColor is getting an empty (\"\") String as an argument, We can see color is coming from a collection named ListTheColorTone:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty String\n  \n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nWhat does this mean to us?\nThe ListTheColorTone collection is perhaps missing an element at the position that is passed. Or some other logic in your application is incorrect. As @Zabuzard advised, try printing the value of position (or perhaps the contents of the collection) to understand what's going wrong:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty string\n\n  println(\"position: $position\")\n  println(\"ListTheColorTone: ${ListTheColorTone.toList()}\")\n  println(\"color: $color\")\n\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nOr even better, try adding a breakpoint at the line where the exception is thrown and check the value of position and ListTheColorTone.size.

        "Answer": "String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \") + 1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n\nThis line is a problem when you name only has one space inside it (ex: \"John Doe\"). It will look for a substring between the index of the first space (4 in thsis case) in the name + 1 and the last space which is the same one! So in this case you are asking for a substring between 5 and the lesser 4 which will give an error.\nIf you can, I recommend the split method. This will work with multiple names:\nStringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(\" \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + \". \");\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n\n",

Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

        "Title": "OutOfBoundsException when converting Java.awt.Polygon to a LibGDX polygon",
        "Question": "Introduction\nI have been attempting to draw filled polygons using LibGDX's ShapeRenderer by converting Java.awt.Polygon into float arrays, then passing these into the ShapeRenderer's polygon(float[]) method. I have noticed that for polygons with a large amount of npoints (in this case 4370), I keep getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException. This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,...

I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n. If both are true, then I have a sublime number on my hands, if either one or both are false, I don't.\nHere's the error for 12, which is a sublime number:\nsublime(12)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 12-element Vector{Int64} at index [14]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[78]:1\n\nFor comparison, here are the error messages for 24 and 48:\nsublime(24)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 24-element Vector{Int64} at index [30]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[80]:1\n\nsublime(48)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 48-element Vector{Int64} at index [62]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[82]:1\n\n\nI hope my information can provide some clues on to solving the current problem!\n",

        "Question": "I am getting IndexOutOfBoundsException when I remove items in mutableStateListOf, where MyType is some custom Type. There are almost around 250 items in myList. The items are removed in a loop. Almost 6 elements are visible in viewport at one time. When the item count reaches less than or equal to 6(with scroll position at top) then this exception is raised and the application crashes.\nFurthoremore, the application is crashed only when Listview is the active screen. Otherwise it doesnot crash/ this indexoutofboundexception is not raised. I have debugged the application logic and made sure that there are checks to ignore any update/add/remove request with index larger than list size. I suspect the exception is raised during recomposition only. Another behaviour I observed is when the List is scrolled to the bottom and the items are removed, then this exception is already raised at the very beginning of the loop.

As pointed out in replies, even if it doesnt give segmentation fault, why doesn't it swap arr[j] with garbage value in arr[i](where i is out of bounds)?\nint HoarePartition(int a[],int l,int r)\n{\n    int p,i,j,temp;\n    p=a[l],i=l,j=r+1;\n    do\n    {\n        do\n        {\n            i++;\n        }while(a[i]<p);\n        do\n        {\n            j--;\n        }while(a[j]>p);\n        temp=a[i];\n        a[i]=a[j];\n        a[j]=temp;\n    }while(i<j);\n    temp=a[i];\n    a[i]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    temp=a[l];\n    a[l]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    return j;\n}\n\nThis along with quicksort function gives correct sorted array for input array of 5 4 3 2 1 or similar decreasing array.\n",
        "Answer": "\nShouldn't that give segmentation error?\n\nNo. Segmentation faults are not specified to catch errors of going outside bounds of individual arrays or other objects within a process. They are specified, on operating systems that have them, to catch errors of accessing memory with incorrect permissions for the process, such as attempting to read outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to read, attempting to write outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to write, or attempting to execute instructions outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to execute.\nWhen a process has two arrays, a and b, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a into b will not generate a segmentation fault, because the process has permission to read b. When a process has an array a in the memory allocated (and mapped) for its stack, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a but is still within its stack space will not generate a segmentation fault.\n\nWhy does the code give correct output?\n\nImmediately after swapping a[i] and a[j] inside the do loop, the routine immediately swaps them back, reversing the change. This is because, once i is out of bounds, i<j is false, because j starts at r+1 and is decremented, so we know it is in bounds and hence is less than i. So the loop with while(i<j) terminates, and the code immediately after it, which swaps a[i] and a[j], is executed.\nSo, as long as no segment fault occurs, any swap with an element outside of the array is immediately reversed and has no lasting effect.\n",

        "Title": "Conditional button still executing action when false (not visible)",
        "Question": "I have a very simple SwiftUI app that shows a German word with its English translation. There is a \"Next\" button to cycle through a word list, which is swapped out for a \"Done\" button to restart the list if it is the last word.\nHere is the relevant code:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n  @State private var index = 0\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    let english = Word.words[index].english\n    let german = Word.words[index].german\n    \n    ZStack {\n      Color(\"BackgroundColor\")\n        .ignoresSafeArea()\n      VStack(spacing: 20) {\n        Spacer()\n        TitleView(word: german)\n        CaptionView(word: english)\n        Spacer()\n        if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n          Button {\n            index += 1\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Next Word\")\n          }\n        } else {\n          Button {\n            index = 0\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Done\")\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTapping repeatedly on \"Next\" and \"Done\" works as expected: the word list is iterated over and then reset to the beginning.\nHowever, when I tap quickly on these buttons, the app crashes with an Index out of range error. This happens when the \"Done\" button is displayed and tapped on. It also can occur when \"Done\" is not tapped on, but another area of the screen is tapped. As an example: I can alternate my taps between Button and TitleWord, and this will eventually cause the same crash. The only interactive components in the app are these two (conditional) buttons.\nWhat is causing the index to become out of range? It seems like I have introduced a race condition, but I don't know how.\n===\nUpdate:\nI fixed the problem with a simple check before incrementing index:\nif index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n  Button {\n    if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n      index += 1\n    }\n  } label: {\n    Text(\"Next Word\")\n  }\n} \n\nSince I am repeating the conditional, this tells me that there is indeed a race condition.\n",
        "Answer": "SwiftUI refreshes a view when something is updated like when a @State property is updated, this isn\u2019t done directly instead SwiftUI works in cycles so that all updates that has happened during a cycle will be seen in the next refresh of the UI.\nSo this is what happens when you press the buttons quickly, `index\u2019 gets updated by more than 1 during a cycle and you risk getting an array out of index error.\n",

        "Title": "Where in the standard to I read or deduce that vector&lt;T&gt;::operator[] invokes UB for out-of-bound input?",
        "Question": "On cppreference, I read the following about std::vector<T,Allocator>::operator[]:\n\nAccessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.\n\nDoes the standard draft contain a similar sentence? Or, what part of the standard should I deduce this thing from?\nI guess that if the standard says nothing about it, that would make it UB. But I haven't found anything about std::vector<T,Allocator>::at either, so...\n",
        "Answer": "It's specified in a very roundabout way.\nFirst, the members aren't specified for vector directly, but instead for the general Sequence. You can find the specification here: http://eel.is/c++draft/sequence.reqmts.\nFirst, the obvious part: at has the clause\n\nThrows: out_of_range if n >= a.size().\n\nSo this is where at's behavior comes from.\nAs for [], it says:\n\nReturns: *(a.begin() + n)\n\nSo the effect is the same as of that expression. We need to follow this to find the undefined behavior. For that we need to look at the iterator requirements.\nNow the C++20 requirements are nigh-unreadable, but the C++17 requirements are still there and do apply. So:\n\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#random.access.iterators-1 says that a + n (for some iterator a and a difference n) means doing tmp += n for a copy tmp of a.\nSame place says that r += n means repeated applications of ++r (or --r if n is negative).\nIn http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#tab:inputiterator we learn that ++r and *a both have the precondition that r or a respectively are dereferenceable. Note that violating a precondition means undefined behavior in C++ standardese.\n\nThis is where it gets really complicated. At this point we need to piece together the specifications of vector::begin and vector::end to understand that repeated incrementing of v.begin() will eventually (as in, after v.size() applications) yield v.end(), which is specified to be the past-the-end iterator. I cannot find the explicit statement that such iterators are not dereferenceable, but http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#general-7 specifies that the standard library assumes they are not, and in vector's case this is true.\nTherefore, v[v.size()] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size()), which is equivalent to *v.end(), which is undefined behavior.\nAnd v[v.size()+1] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size() + 1), which is equivalent to *std::next(v.end()), which is incrementing the past-the-end iterator and thus undefined behavior.\n",

        "Answer": "A number of people have already pointed out in the comments that your code currently has undefined behavior.\nAs far as ordering goes, you are guaranteed that as you've defined things right now x and y are in order--that is, y will have a higher memory address than x. But there could be padding in between them, so that there's less overlap than you expect, or possibly no overlap at all. In addition, the standard is written to allow (but not require) that array indices can be checked for validity, so even if they're immediately next to each other, the compiler is allowed to check that since you defined x to have 10 elements, any attempt at indexing beyond the 10th element will fail (e.g., cause a hardware interrupt or fault).\nThat leaves the question about how to get the result you apparently want, but with defined behavior. You have a couple of choices. One is to allocate a single array, and add an alias that allows you to treat half of it as if it were a separate array:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[20];\n    double *y = &x[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe other direction you could go would be to keep the two arrays separate, but then add a small proxy to allow addressing into both arrays as if they were one:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass proxy {\n    double *x_;\n    size_t N;\n    double *y_;\npublic:\n    template <class T, std::size_t N>\n    proxy(T (&x_)[N], T *y) : x_(x_), N(N), y_(y) {}\n\n    double &operator[](std::size_t n) {\n        if (n < N)\n            return x_[n];\n        else\n            return y_[n-N];\n    }\n};\n\nclass A{\n    double x_[10];\npublic:\n    double y[10];\n    proxy x{x_, y};\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nUnless you really need to use separate arrays for the two items, the first is probably preferable \u2013 it's clearly simpler and probably faster.\n",

        "Answer": "You can simplify your Adapter by using ListAdapter. It will manage updating the list and animate any changed (see also DiffCallback for better update handling).\nListAdapter supports your approach with data changes via LiveData. When a new data set is submitted you just call adapter.submitList(dataList) to update the adapter.\n",

What am I doing wrong?\nHere is a screenshot for reference:\n\n",
        "Answer": "The StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is an unchecked exception that occurs when an attempt is made to access the character of a string at an index which is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\n\nThrown by String methods to indicate that an index is either negative or greater than the size of the string. For some methods such as the charAt method, this exception also is thrown when the index is equal to the size of the string.\n\nSo something somewhere is trying to access a character at an index that is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\nIf we look at the stacktrace we can see that the exception is thrown from the Color.parseColor method:\n// TIP: Length of 0 means an empty string!\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0; index=0\n  at java.lang.String.charAt(Native Method)\n  at android.graphics.Color.parseColor(Color.java:1384)\n  // The stack trace is guiding us to line 33!\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:33)\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:15)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7065)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.bindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7107)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler.tryBindViewHolderByDeadline (RecyclerView.java:6012)\n\nTherefore, Color.parseColor is getting an empty (\"\") String as an argument, We can see color is coming from a collection named ListTheColorTone:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty String\n  \n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nWhat does this mean to us?\nThe ListTheColorTone collection is perhaps missing an element at the position that is passed. Or some other logic in your application is incorrect. As @Zabuzard advised, try printing the value of position (or perhaps the contents of the collection) to understand what's going wrong:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty string\n\n  println(\"position: $position\")\n  println(\"ListTheColorTone: ${ListTheColorTone.toList()}\")\n  println(\"color: $color\")\n\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nOr even better, try adding a breakpoint at the line where the exception is thrown and check the value of position and ListTheColorTone.size.

I've tried looking at other resources, but I'm not really allowed to use concepts outside of what we've learned and what's given as criteria for this assignment.\n// Below this comment: import the Scanner\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Initials {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      // Below this comment: declare and instantiate a Scanner\n      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);\n      \n      // Below this comment: collect the required inputs\n      System.out.println(\"Enter name : \");\n        String name = scnr.next();\n      \n      \n      // Below this comment: call your required method\n      String initials = getInitials(name);\n      \n      \n      // Below this comment: disply the required results\n      System.out.println(\"Initials for \" + name + \" : \" + initials);\n      \n   }\n   \n   // define your required method here below\n   public static String getInitials(String name){\n      String firstName = name.substring(0, name.indexOf(\" \"));\n      String firstInit = firstName.substring(0, 1);\n      String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \")+1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n      String middleInit = middleName.substring(0, 1);\n      String lastName = name.substring((name.lastIndexOf(\" \")+1), name.length());\n      String lastInit = lastName.substring(0, 1);\n      String initials = (firstInit + \". \" + middleInit + \". \" + lastInit + \".\");\n      return initials;\n   }\n}\n\nThis is the error zyBooks displays:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: begin 0, end -1, length 3\n    at java.base/java.lang.String.checkBoundsBeginEnd(String.java:3319)\n    at java.base/java.lang.String.substring(String.java:1874)\n    at Initials.getInitials(Initials.java:24)\n    at Initials.main(Initials.java:14)\n\nI know it has something to do with the code trying to access stuff outside of my parameters, but I'm not sure what to tweak to make sure that doesn't happen. I think I need an if statement but I don't know. Any help is appreciated!\nSorry if this post isn't clarified that well. I've been working on this all day and I have a headache.\n",
        "Answer": "String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \") + 1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n\nThis line is a problem when you name only has one space inside it (ex: \"John Doe\"). It will look for a substring between the index of the first space (4 in thsis case) in the name + 1 and the last space which is the same one! So in this case you are asking for a substring between 5 and the lesser 4 which will give an error.\nIf you can, I recommend the split method. This will work with multiple names:\nStringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(\" \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + \". \");\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n\n",

        "Title": "Is a blank try and catch IndexOutOfBoundsException valid at the end of a while loop of if statements in C#?",
        "Question": "I'm finishing an unfinished C# WinForms project, which is a save game editor for an unspecified game. I noticed that character portraits and icons' IDs have a valid range of 1 to 905, but there was no code to verify that the character ID is within that range, so I opted to fix it. I have an in-progress solution to this, with the code for it (with a lot of function names partially redacted) at the end of this post, and wanted to know if it would work. Visual Studio says there are no formatting errors, but I know that alone will not quite be enough. I cannot compile to test because I am not quite at a stage where the code is compilable, with a lot of missing WinForms data. If the specific exception that I placed would not be appropriate, what exception would best fit? If a while loop should not be used in this way, what method should I use that doesn't require rewriting the entire code block from scratch? Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Title": "My code for checking whether a number is a sublime number or not curiously fails for multiples of 12 (a sublime number itself). Does anyone know why?",
        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,... (so the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and I assume every multiple following that sequence afterwards). I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n. If both are true, then I have a sublime number on my hands, if either one or both are false, I don't.\nHere's the error for 12, which is a sublime number:\nsublime(12)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 12-element Vector{Int64} at index [14]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[78]:1\n\nFor comparison, here are the error messages for 24 and 48:\nsublime(24)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 24-element Vector{Int64} at index [30]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[80]:1\n\nsublime(48)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 48-element Vector{Int64} at index [62]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[82]:1\n\n\nI hope my information can provide some clues on to solving the current problem!\n",

        "Question": "In this code for quicksort, if input array is decreasing, for example 5 4 3 2 1 , variable i goes on incrementing without check and go out of array bound. Shouldn't that give segmentation error?

        "Answer": "\nShouldn't that give segmentation error?\n\nNo. Segmentation faults are not specified to catch errors of going outside bounds of individual arrays or other objects within a process. They are specified, on operating systems that have them, to catch errors of accessing memory with incorrect permissions for the process, such as attempting to read outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to read, attempting to write outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to write, or attempting to execute instructions outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to execute.\nWhen a process has two arrays, a and b, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a into b will not generate a segmentation fault, because the process has permission to read b. When a process has an array a in the memory allocated (and mapped) for its stack, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a but is still within its stack space will not generate a segmentation fault.\n\nWhy does the code give correct output?\n\nImmediately after swapping a[i] and a[j] inside the do loop, the routine immediately swaps them back, reversing the change. This is because, once i is out of bounds, i<j is false, because j starts at r+1 and is decremented, so we know it is in bounds and hence is less than i. So the loop with while(i<j) terminates, and the code immediately after it, which swaps a[i] and a[j], is executed.\nSo, as long as no segment fault occurs, any swap with an element outside of the array is immediately reversed and has no lasting effect.\n",

        "Question": "I have a very simple SwiftUI app that shows a German word with its English translation. There is a \"Next\" button to cycle through a word list, which is swapped out for a \"Done\" button to restart the list if it is the last word.\nHere is the relevant code:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n  @State private var index = 0\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    let english = Word.words[index].english\n    let german = Word.words[index].german\n    \n    ZStack {\n      Color(\"BackgroundColor\")\n        .ignoresSafeArea()\n      VStack(spacing: 20) {\n        Spacer()\n        TitleView(word: german)\n        CaptionView(word: english)\n        Spacer()\n        if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n          Button {\n            index += 1\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Next Word\")\n          }\n        } else {\n          Button {\n            index = 0\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Done\")\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTapping repeatedly on \"Next\" and \"Done\" works as expected: the word list is iterated over and then reset to the beginning.\nHowever, when I tap quickly on these buttons, the app crashes with an Index out of range error. This happens when the \"Done\" button is displayed and tapped on. It also can occur when \"Done\" is not tapped on, but another area of the screen is tapped. As an example: I can alternate my taps between Button and TitleWord, and this will eventually cause the same crash. The only interactive components in the app are these two (conditional) buttons.\nWhat is causing the index to become out of range? It seems like I have introduced a race condition, but I don't know how.\n===\nUpdate:\nI fixed the problem with a simple check before incrementing index:\nif index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n  Button {\n    if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n      index += 1\n    }\n  } label: {\n    Text(\"Next Word\")\n  }\n} \n\nSince I am repeating the conditional, this tells me that there is indeed a race condition.\n",

        "Question": "On cppreference, I read the following about std::vector<T,Allocator>::operator[]:\n\nAccessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.\n\nDoes the standard draft contain a similar sentence? Or, what part of the standard should I deduce this thing from?\nI guess that if the standard says nothing about it, that would make it UB. But I haven't found anything about std::vector<T,Allocator>::at either, so...\n",
        "Answer": "It's specified in a very roundabout way.\nFirst, the members aren't specified for vector directly, but instead for the general Sequence. You can find the specification here: http://eel.is/c++draft/sequence.reqmts.\nFirst, the obvious part: at has the clause\n\nThrows: out_of_range if n >= a.size().\n\nSo this is where at's behavior comes from.\nAs for [], it says:\n\nReturns: *(a.begin() + n)\n\nSo the effect is the same as of that expression. We need to follow this to find the undefined behavior. For that we need to look at the iterator requirements.\nNow the C++20 requirements are nigh-unreadable, but the C++17 requirements are still there and do apply. So:\n\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#random.access.iterators-1 says that a + n (for some iterator a and a difference n) means doing tmp += n for a copy tmp of a.\nSame place says that r += n means repeated applications of ++r (or --r if n is negative).\nIn http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#tab:inputiterator we learn that ++r and *a both have the precondition that r or a respectively are dereferenceable. Note that violating a precondition means undefined behavior in C++ standardese.\n\nThis is where it gets really complicated. At this point we need to piece together the specifications of vector::begin and vector::end to understand that repeated incrementing of v.begin() will eventually (as in, after v.size() applications) yield v.end(), which is specified to be the past-the-end iterator. I cannot find the explicit statement that such iterators are not dereferenceable, but http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#general-7 specifies that the standard library assumes they are not, and in vector's case this is true.\nTherefore, v[v.size()] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size()), which is equivalent to *v.end(), which is undefined behavior.\nAnd v[v.size()+1] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size() + 1), which is equivalent to *std::next(v.end()), which is incrementing the past-the-end iterator and thus undefined behavior.\n",

In addition, the standard is written to allow (but not require) that array indices can be checked for validity, so even if they're immediately next to each other, the compiler is allowed to check that since you defined x to have 10 elements, any attempt at indexing beyond the 10th element will fail (e.g., cause a hardware interrupt or fault).\nThat leaves the question about how to get the result you apparently want, but with defined behavior.

One is to allocate a single array, and add an alias that allows you to treat half of it as if it were a separate array:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[20];\n    double *y = &x[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe other direction you could go would be to keep the two arrays separate, but then add a small proxy to allow addressing into both arrays as if they were one:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass proxy {\n    double *x_;\n    size_t N;\n    double *y_;\npublic:\n    template <class T, std::size_t N>\n    proxy(T (&x_)[N], T *y) : x_(x_), N(N), y_(y) {}\n\n    double &operator[](std::size_t n) {\n        if (n < N)\n            return x_[n];\n        else\n            return y_[n-N];\n    }\n};\n\nclass A{\n    double x_[10];\npublic:\n    double y[10];\n    proxy x{x_, y};\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nUnless you really need to use separate arrays for the two items, the first is probably preferable \u2013 it's clearly simpler and probably faster.\n",

The variable must be able to be larger than the number of objects in the string array, so far I get \"IndexOutOfRangeException, which is to be expected. I would like it to keep looking and just start over in the array, much like a loop would work.\nSo these are the relevant strings for what I've tried:\nstring alf = (\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\");\n\nstring[] alflist = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"u\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"};\n\n\nWhat I've tried is this:\nstring output = alflist[Encryption.key];\nWhere Encryption.key is called form another class, and this is the int that could be (and in this instance is) larger than the 26 positions of alflist.\nIf Encryption.key = 30 I would like output to be = \"e\" (since a=0 & 26).\nI have also tried to use alf.substring(Encryption.key, 1) but I get the same error.\nThanks for any guidance on this\n",
        "Answer": "You can use the modulus (%) operator. Also, strings can already provide characters by index using the same bracket notation as arrays; there's no need to create a separate array:\nstring alf = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\nint index = Encryption.Key % alf.Length;\nchar result = alf[index];\n\nOr if you need a string instead of a character:\nstring alf = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\nint index = Encryption.Key % alf.Length;\nstring result = alf[index].ToString();\n\nBut if you did want an array, you can could get it like this:\nstring alf = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\nvar alfArray = alf.ToCharArray(); // List is not an array.

Or some other logic in your application is incorrect. As @Zabuzard advised, try printing the value of position (or perhaps the contents of the collection) to understand what's going wrong:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty string\n\n  println(\"position: $position\")\n  println(\"ListTheColorTone: ${ListTheColorTone.toList()}\")\n  println(\"color: $color\")\n\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nOr even better, try adding a breakpoint at the line where the exception is thrown and check the value of position and ListTheColorTone.size.

        "Answer": "String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \") + 1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n\nThis line is a problem when you name only has one space inside it (ex: \"John Doe\"). It will look for a substring between the index of the first space (4 in thsis case) in the name + 1 and the last space which is the same one! So in this case you are asking for a substring between 5 and the lesser 4 which will give an error.\nIf you can, I recommend the split method. This will work with multiple names:\nStringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(\" \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + \". \");\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n\n",

I noticed that character portraits and icons' IDs have a valid range of 1 to 905, but there was no code to verify that the character ID is within that range, so I opted to fix it. I have an in-progress solution to this, with the code for it (with a lot of function names partially redacted) at the end of this post, and wanted to know if it would work. Visual Studio says there are no formatting errors, but I know that alone will not quite be enough. I cannot compile to test because I am not quite at a stage where the code is compilable, with a lot of missing WinForms data. If the specific exception that I placed would not be appropriate, what exception would best fit? If a while loop should not be used in this way, what method should I use that doesn't require rewriting the entire code block from scratch? Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

        "Title": "OutOfBoundsException when converting Java.awt.Polygon to a LibGDX polygon",
        "Question": "Introduction\nI have been attempting to draw filled polygons using LibGDX's ShapeRenderer by converting Java.awt.Polygon into float arrays, then passing these into the ShapeRenderer's polygon(float[]) method. I have noticed that for polygons with a large amount of npoints (in this case 4370), I keep getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException. This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,... (so the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and I assume every multiple following that sequence afterwards). I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n.

        "Answer": "I believe the error has nothing to do with your harmonic numbers. Input values are the problem. If you look into the exception carefully you will see that it is thrown at the line where you extract the parameters from the command line arguments args[N]. For that is the only place where you operate with arrays in your code.\nTry this code:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    if (args.length != 2) {\n        System.out.println(\"The program requires 2 arguments.

        "Title": "Why this quicksort implementation gives correct output instead of garbage value?",
        "Question": "In this code for quicksort, if input array is decreasing, for example 5 4 3 2 1 , variable i goes on incrementing without check and go out of array bound. Shouldn't that give segmentation error? As pointed out in replies, even if it doesnt give segmentation fault, why doesn't it swap arr[j] with garbage value in arr[i](where i is out of bounds)?\nint HoarePartition(int a[],int l,int r)\n{\n    int p,i,j,temp;\n    p=a[l],i=l,j=r+1;\n    do\n    {\n        do\n        {\n            i++;\n        }while(a[i]<p);\n        do\n        {\n            j--;\n        }while(a[j]>p);\n        temp=a[i];\n        a[i]=a[j];\n        a[j]=temp;\n    }while(i<j);\n    temp=a[i];\n    a[i]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    temp=a[l];\n    a[l]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    return j;\n}\n\nThis along with quicksort function gives correct sorted array for input array of 5 4 3 2 1 or similar decreasing array.\n",
        "Answer": "\nShouldn't that give segmentation error?\n\nNo. Segmentation faults are not specified to catch errors of going outside bounds of individual arrays or other objects within a process. They are specified, on operating systems that have them, to catch errors of accessing memory with incorrect permissions for the process, such as attempting to read outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to read, attempting to write outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to write, or attempting to execute instructions outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to execute.\nWhen a process has two arrays, a and b, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a into b will not generate a segmentation fault, because the process has permission to read b. When a process has an array a in the memory allocated (and mapped) for its stack, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a but is still within its stack space will not generate a segmentation fault.\n\nWhy does the code give correct output?\n\nImmediately after swapping a[i] and a[j] inside the do loop, the routine immediately swaps them back, reversing the change. This is because, once i is out of bounds, i<j is false, because j starts at r+1 and is decremented, so we know it is in bounds and hence is less than i. So the loop with while(i<j) terminates, and the code immediately after it, which swaps a[i] and a[j], is executed.\nSo, as long as no segment fault occurs, any swap with an element outside of the array is immediately reversed and has no lasting effect.\n",

        "Title": "Conditional button still executing action when false (not visible)",
        "Question": "I have a very simple SwiftUI app that shows a German word with its English translation. There is a \"Next\" button to cycle through a word list, which is swapped out for a \"Done\" button to restart the list if it is the last word.\nHere is the relevant code:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n  @State private var index = 0\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    let english = Word.words[index].english\n    let german = Word.words[index].german\n    \n    ZStack {\n      Color(\"BackgroundColor\")\n        .ignoresSafeArea()\n      VStack(spacing: 20) {\n        Spacer()\n        TitleView(word: german)\n        CaptionView(word: english)\n        Spacer()\n        if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n          Button {\n            index += 1\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Next Word\")\n          }\n        } else {\n          Button {\n            index = 0\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Done\")\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTapping repeatedly on \"Next\" and \"Done\" works as expected: the word list is iterated over and then reset to the beginning.\nHowever, when I tap quickly on these buttons, the app crashes with an Index out of range error. This happens when the \"Done\" button is displayed and tapped on. It also can occur when \"Done\" is not tapped on, but another area of the screen is tapped. As an example: I can alternate my taps between Button and TitleWord, and this will eventually cause the same crash. The only interactive components in the app are these two (conditional) buttons.\nWhat is causing the index to become out of range? It seems like I have introduced a race condition, but I don't know how.\n===\nUpdate:\nI fixed the problem with a simple check before incrementing index:\nif index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n  Button {\n    if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n      index += 1\n    }\n  } label: {\n    Text(\"Next Word\")\n  }\n} \n\nSince I am repeating the conditional, this tells me that there is indeed a race condition.\n",

        "Title": "Where in the standard to I read or deduce that vector&lt;T&gt;::operator[] invokes UB for out-of-bound input?",
        "Question": "On cppreference, I read the following about std::vector<T,Allocator>::operator[]:\n\nAccessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.\n\nDoes the standard draft contain a similar sentence? Or, what part of the standard should I deduce this thing from?\nI guess that if the standard says nothing about it, that would make it UB. But I haven't found anything about std::vector<T,Allocator>::at either, so...\n",
        "Answer": "It's specified in a very roundabout way.\nFirst, the members aren't specified for vector directly, but instead for the general Sequence. You can find the specification here: http://eel.is/c++draft/sequence.reqmts.\nFirst, the obvious part: at has the clause\n\nThrows: out_of_range if n >= a.size().\n\nSo this is where at's behavior comes from.\nAs for [], it says:\n\nReturns: *(a.begin() + n)\n\nSo the effect is the same as of that expression. We need to follow this to find the undefined behavior. For that we need to look at the iterator requirements.\nNow the C++20 requirements are nigh-unreadable, but the C++17 requirements are still there and do apply. So:\n\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#random.access.iterators-1 says that a + n (for some iterator a and a difference n) means doing tmp += n for a copy tmp of a.\nSame place says that r += n means repeated applications of ++r (or --r if n is negative).\nIn http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#tab:inputiterator we learn that ++r and *a both have the precondition that r or a respectively are dereferenceable. Note that violating a precondition means undefined behavior in C++ standardese.\n\nThis is where it gets really complicated. At this point we need to piece together the specifications of vector::begin and vector::end to understand that repeated incrementing of v.begin() will eventually (as in, after v.size() applications) yield v.end(), which is specified to be the past-the-end iterator. I cannot find the explicit statement that such iterators are not dereferenceable, but http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#general-7 specifies that the standard library assumes they are not, and in vector's case this is true.\nTherefore, v[v.size()] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size()), which is equivalent to *v.end(), which is undefined behavior.\nAnd v[v.size()+1] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size() + 1), which is equivalent to *std::next(v.end()), which is incrementing the past-the-end iterator and thus undefined behavior.\n",

        "Answer": "It\u2019s because the array slice isn\u2019t copying the elements and creating a new array, but it creates a \u201cpointer\u201d to the initial one instead, so the indices don\u2019t apply here the same way they would for a new array. This is implemented this way for the benefit of memory efficiency. This is really well described in the Apple developer documentation, as well as how the indices are being kept from the initial array.\n",

        "Title": "c++ stack order asserted?",
        "Question": "Is the following code under every compliant compiler optimization asserted to return the value 14? Is this recommendable to use? Is this more efficient than introducing two pointers onto a common array? Has the below stack technique a specific name? Which better practice yields the exact same binary upon compilation under reasonable or admirable assumptions?\n#include <iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[10];\n    double y[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nWhere can I look up determinations like these? (links, references). I guess there is a trick to reading the standard efficiently.\n",
        "Answer": "A number of people have already pointed out in the comments that your code currently has undefined behavior.\nAs far as ordering goes, you are guaranteed that as you've defined things right now x and y are in order--that is, y will have a higher memory address than x. But there could be padding in between them, so that there's less overlap than you expect, or possibly no overlap at all. In addition, the standard is written to allow (but not require) that array indices can be checked for validity, so even if they're immediately next to each other, the compiler is allowed to check that since you defined x to have 10 elements, any attempt at indexing beyond the 10th element will fail (e.g., cause a hardware interrupt or fault).\nThat leaves the question about how to get the result you apparently want, but with defined behavior. You have a couple of choices. One is to allocate a single array, and add an alias that allows you to treat half of it as if it were a separate array:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[20];\n    double *y = &x[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe other direction you could go would be to keep the two arrays separate, but then add a small proxy to allow addressing into both arrays as if they were one:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass proxy {\n    double *x_;\n    size_t N;\n    double *y_;\npublic:\n    template <class T, std::size_t N>\n    proxy(T (&x_)[N], T *y) : x_(x_), N(N), y_(y) {}\n\n    double &operator[](std::size_t n) {\n        if (n < N)\n            return x_[n];\n        else\n            return y_[n-N];\n    }\n};\n\nclass A{\n    double x_[10];\npublic:\n    double y[10];\n    proxy x{x_, y};\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nUnless you really need to use separate arrays for the two items, the first is probably preferable \u2013 it's clearly simpler and probably faster.\n",

The variable must be able to be larger than the number of objects in the string array, so far I get \"IndexOutOfRangeException, which is to be expected.

        "Answer": "You can simplify your Adapter by using ListAdapter. It will manage updating the list and animate any changed (see also DiffCallback for better update handling).\nListAdapter supports your approach with data changes via LiveData. When a new data set is submitted you just call adapter.submitList(dataList) to update the adapter.\n",

        "Answer": "The StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is an unchecked exception that occurs when an attempt is made to access the character of a string at an index which is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\n\nThrown by String methods to indicate that an index is either negative or greater than the size of the string. For some methods such as the charAt method, this exception also is thrown when the index is equal to the size of the string.\n\nSo something somewhere is trying to access a character at an index that is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\nIf we look at the stacktrace we can see that the exception is thrown from the Color.parseColor method:\n// TIP: Length of 0 means an empty string!\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0; index=0\n  at java.lang.String.charAt(Native Method)\n  at android.graphics.Color.parseColor(Color.java:1384)\n  // The stack trace is guiding us to line 33!\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:33)\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:15)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7065)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.bindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7107)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler.tryBindViewHolderByDeadline (RecyclerView.java:6012)\n\nTherefore, Color.parseColor is getting an empty (\"\") String as an argument, We can see color is coming from a collection named ListTheColorTone:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty String\n  \n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nWhat does this mean to us?\nThe ListTheColorTone collection is perhaps missing an element at the position that is passed. Or some other logic in your application is incorrect. As @Zabuzard advised, try printing the value of position (or perhaps the contents of the collection) to understand what's going wrong:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty string\n\n  println(\"position: $position\")\n  println(\"ListTheColorTone: ${ListTheColorTone.toList()}\")\n  println(\"color: $color\")\n\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nOr even better, try adding a breakpoint at the line where the exception is thrown and check the value of position and ListTheColorTone.size.

        "Answer": "String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \") + 1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n\nThis line is a problem when you name only has one space inside it (ex: \"John Doe\"). It will look for a substring between the index of the first space (4 in thsis case) in the name + 1 and the last space which is the same one! So in this case you are asking for a substring between 5 and the lesser 4 which will give an error.\nIf you can, I recommend the split method. This will work with multiple names:\nStringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(\" \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + \". \");\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n\n",

I noticed that character portraits and icons' IDs have a valid range of 1 to 905, but there was no code to verify that the character ID is within that range, so I opted to fix it. I have an in-progress solution to this, with the code for it (with a lot of function names partially redacted) at the end of this post, and wanted to know if it would work. Visual Studio says there are no formatting errors, but I know that alone will not quite be enough. I cannot compile to test because I am not quite at a stage where the code is compilable, with a lot of missing WinForms data. If the specific exception that I placed would not be appropriate, what exception would best fit? If a while loop should not be used in this way, what method should I use that doesn't require rewriting the entire code block from scratch? Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

        "Title": "OutOfBoundsException when converting Java.awt.Polygon to a LibGDX polygon",
        "Question": "Introduction\nI have been attempting to draw filled polygons using LibGDX's ShapeRenderer by converting Java.awt.Polygon into float arrays, then passing these into the ShapeRenderer's polygon(float[]) method. I have noticed that for polygons with a large amount of npoints (in this case 4370), I keep getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException. This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,...

I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n. If both are true, then I have a sublime number on my hands, if either one or both are false, I don't.\nHere's the error for 12, which is a sublime number:\nsublime(12)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 12-element Vector{Int64} at index [14]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[78]:1\n\nFor comparison, here are the error messages for 24 and 48:\nsublime(24)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 24-element Vector{Int64} at index [30]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[80]:1\n\nsublime(48)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 48-element Vector{Int64} at index [62]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[82]:1\n\n\nI hope my information can provide some clues on to solving the current problem!\n",

        "Question": "I am getting IndexOutOfBoundsException when I remove items in mutableStateListOf, where MyType is some custom Type. There are almost around 250 items in myList. The items are removed in a loop. Almost 6 elements are visible in viewport at one time. When the item count reaches less than or equal to 6(with scroll position at top) then this exception is raised and the application crashes.\nFurthoremore, the application is crashed only when Listview is the active screen. Otherwise it doesnot crash/ this indexoutofboundexception is not raised. I have debugged the application logic and made sure that there are checks to ignore any update/add/remove request with index larger than list size. I suspect the exception is raised during recomposition only. Another behaviour I observed is when the List is scrolled to the bottom and the items are removed, then this exception is already raised at the very beginning of the loop.

As pointed out in replies, even if it doesnt give segmentation fault, why doesn't it swap arr[j] with garbage value in arr[i](where i is out of bounds)?\nint HoarePartition(int a[],int l,int r)\n{\n    int p,i,j,temp;\n    p=a[l],i=l,j=r+1;\n    do\n    {\n        do\n        {\n            i++;\n        }while(a[i]<p);\n        do\n        {\n            j--;\n        }while(a[j]>p);\n        temp=a[i];\n        a[i]=a[j];\n        a[j]=temp;\n    }while(i<j);\n    temp=a[i];\n    a[i]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    temp=a[l];\n    a[l]=a[j];\n    a[j]=temp;\n    return j;\n}\n\nThis along with quicksort function gives correct sorted array for input array of 5 4 3 2 1 or similar decreasing array.\n",
        "Answer": "\nShouldn't that give segmentation error?\n\nNo. Segmentation faults are not specified to catch errors of going outside bounds of individual arrays or other objects within a process. They are specified, on operating systems that have them, to catch errors of accessing memory with incorrect permissions for the process, such as attempting to read outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to read, attempting to write outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to write, or attempting to execute instructions outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to execute.\nWhen a process has two arrays, a and b, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a into b will not generate a segmentation fault, because the process has permission to read b. When a process has an array a in the memory allocated (and mapped) for its stack, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a but is still within its stack space will not generate a segmentation fault.\n\nWhy does the code give correct output?\n\nImmediately after swapping a[i] and a[j] inside the do loop, the routine immediately swaps them back, reversing the change. This is because, once i is out of bounds, i<j is false, because j starts at r+1 and is decremented, so we know it is in bounds and hence is less than i. So the loop with while(i<j) terminates, and the code immediately after it, which swaps a[i] and a[j], is executed.\nSo, as long as no segment fault occurs, any swap with an element outside of the array is immediately reversed and has no lasting effect.\n",

        "Title": "Conditional button still executing action when false (not visible)",
        "Question": "I have a very simple SwiftUI app that shows a German word with its English translation. There is a \"Next\" button to cycle through a word list, which is swapped out for a \"Done\" button to restart the list if it is the last word.\nHere is the relevant code:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n  @State private var index = 0\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    let english = Word.words[index].english\n    let german = Word.words[index].german\n    \n    ZStack {\n      Color(\"BackgroundColor\")\n        .ignoresSafeArea()\n      VStack(spacing: 20) {\n        Spacer()\n        TitleView(word: german)\n        CaptionView(word: english)\n        Spacer()\n        if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n          Button {\n            index += 1\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Next Word\")\n          }\n        } else {\n          Button {\n            index = 0\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Done\")\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTapping repeatedly on \"Next\" and \"Done\" works as expected: the word list is iterated over and then reset to the beginning.\nHowever, when I tap quickly on these buttons, the app crashes with an Index out of range error. This happens when the \"Done\" button is displayed and tapped on. It also can occur when \"Done\" is not tapped on, but another area of the screen is tapped. As an example: I can alternate my taps between Button and TitleWord, and this will eventually cause the same crash. The only interactive components in the app are these two (conditional) buttons.\nWhat is causing the index to become out of range? It seems like I have introduced a race condition, but I don't know how.\n===\nUpdate:\nI fixed the problem with a simple check before incrementing index:\nif index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n  Button {\n    if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n      index += 1\n    }\n  } label: {\n    Text(\"Next Word\")\n  }\n} \n\nSince I am repeating the conditional, this tells me that there is indeed a race condition.\n",
        "Answer": "SwiftUI refreshes a view when something is updated like when a @State property is updated, this isn\u2019t done directly instead SwiftUI works in cycles so that all updates that has happened during a cycle will be seen in the next refresh of the UI.\nSo this is what happens when you press the buttons quickly, `index\u2019 gets updated by more than 1 during a cycle and you risk getting an array out of index error.\n",

        "Title": "Where in the standard to I read or deduce that vector&lt;T&gt;::operator[] invokes UB for out-of-bound input?",
        "Question": "On cppreference, I read the following about std::vector<T,Allocator>::operator[]:\n\nAccessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.\n\nDoes the standard draft contain a similar sentence? Or, what part of the standard should I deduce this thing from?\nI guess that if the standard says nothing about it, that would make it UB. But I haven't found anything about std::vector<T,Allocator>::at either, so...\n",
        "Answer": "It's specified in a very roundabout way.\nFirst, the members aren't specified for vector directly, but instead for the general Sequence. You can find the specification here: http://eel.is/c++draft/sequence.reqmts.\nFirst, the obvious part: at has the clause\n\nThrows: out_of_range if n >= a.size().\n\nSo this is where at's behavior comes from.\nAs for [], it says:\n\nReturns: *(a.begin() + n)\n\nSo the effect is the same as of that expression. We need to follow this to find the undefined behavior. For that we need to look at the iterator requirements.\nNow the C++20 requirements are nigh-unreadable, but the C++17 requirements are still there and do apply. So:\n\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#random.access.iterators-1 says that a + n (for some iterator a and a difference n) means doing tmp += n for a copy tmp of a.\nSame place says that r += n means repeated applications of ++r (or --r if n is negative).\nIn http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#tab:inputiterator we learn that ++r and *a both have the precondition that r or a respectively are dereferenceable. Note that violating a precondition means undefined behavior in C++ standardese.\n\nThis is where it gets really complicated. At this point we need to piece together the specifications of vector::begin and vector::end to understand that repeated incrementing of v.begin() will eventually (as in, after v.size() applications) yield v.end(), which is specified to be the past-the-end iterator. I cannot find the explicit statement that such iterators are not dereferenceable, but http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#general-7 specifies that the standard library assumes they are not, and in vector's case this is true.\nTherefore, v[v.size()] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size()), which is equivalent to *v.end(), which is undefined behavior.\nAnd v[v.size()+1] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size() + 1), which is equivalent to *std::next(v.end()), which is incrementing the past-the-end iterator and thus undefined behavior.\n",

        "Answer": "A number of people have already pointed out in the comments that your code currently has undefined behavior.\nAs far as ordering goes, you are guaranteed that as you've defined things right now x and y are in order--that is, y will have a higher memory address than x. But there could be padding in between them, so that there's less overlap than you expect, or possibly no overlap at all. In addition, the standard is written to allow (but not require) that array indices can be checked for validity, so even if they're immediately next to each other, the compiler is allowed to check that since you defined x to have 10 elements, any attempt at indexing beyond the 10th element will fail (e.g., cause a hardware interrupt or fault).\nThat leaves the question about how to get the result you apparently want, but with defined behavior. You have a couple of choices. One is to allocate a single array, and add an alias that allows you to treat half of it as if it were a separate array:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[20];\n    double *y = &x[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe other direction you could go would be to keep the two arrays separate, but then add a small proxy to allow addressing into both arrays as if they were one:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass proxy {\n    double *x_;\n    size_t N;\n    double *y_;\npublic:\n    template <class T, std::size_t N>\n    proxy(T (&x_)[N], T *y) : x_(x_), N(N), y_(y) {}\n\n    double &operator[](std::size_t n) {\n        if (n < N)\n            return x_[n];\n        else\n            return y_[n-N];\n    }\n};\n\nclass A{\n    double x_[10];\npublic:\n    double y[10];\n    proxy x{x_, y};\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nUnless you really need to use separate arrays for the two items, the first is probably preferable \u2013 it's clearly simpler and probably faster.\n",

        "Answer": "You can simplify your Adapter by using ListAdapter. It will manage updating the list and animate any changed (see also DiffCallback for better update handling).\nListAdapter supports your approach with data changes via LiveData. When a new data set is submitted you just call adapter.submitList(dataList) to update the adapter.\n",

What am I doing wrong?\nHere is a screenshot for reference:\n\n",
        "Answer": "The StringIndexOutOfBoundsException is an unchecked exception that occurs when an attempt is made to access the character of a string at an index which is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\n\nThrown by String methods to indicate that an index is either negative or greater than the size of the string. For some methods such as the charAt method, this exception also is thrown when the index is equal to the size of the string.\n\nSo something somewhere is trying to access a character at an index that is either negative or greater than the length of the string.\nIf we look at the stacktrace we can see that the exception is thrown from the Color.parseColor method:\n// TIP: Length of 0 means an empty string!\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: length=0; index=0\n  at java.lang.String.charAt(Native Method)\n  at android.graphics.Color.parseColor(Color.java:1384)\n  // The stack trace is guiding us to line 33!\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:33)\n  at com.example.wallpaperapp.Adapter.colortoneAdapter.onBindViewHolder(colortoneAdapter.kt:15)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.onBindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7065)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Adapter.bindViewHolder(RecyclerView.java:7107)\n  at androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView$Recycler.tryBindViewHolderByDeadline (RecyclerView.java:6012)\n\nTherefore, Color.parseColor is getting an empty (\"\") String as an argument, We can see color is coming from a collection named ListTheColorTone:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty String\n  \n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nWhat does this mean to us?\nThe ListTheColorTone collection is perhaps missing an element at the position that is passed. Or some other logic in your application is incorrect. As @Zabuzard advised, try printing the value of position (or perhaps the contents of the collection) to understand what's going wrong:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty string\n\n  println(\"position: $position\")\n  println(\"ListTheColorTone: ${ListTheColorTone.toList()}\")\n  println(\"color: $color\")\n\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nOr even better, try adding a breakpoint at the line where the exception is thrown and check the value of position and ListTheColorTone.size.

I've tried looking at other resources, but I'm not really allowed to use concepts outside of what we've learned and what's given as criteria for this assignment.\n// Below this comment: import the Scanner\nimport java.util.Scanner;\npublic class Initials {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n      // Below this comment: declare and instantiate a Scanner\n      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);\n      \n      // Below this comment: collect the required inputs\n      System.out.println(\"Enter name : \");\n        String name = scnr.next();\n      \n      \n      // Below this comment: call your required method\n      String initials = getInitials(name);\n      \n      \n      // Below this comment: disply the required results\n      System.out.println(\"Initials for \" + name + \" : \" + initials);\n      \n   }\n   \n   // define your required method here below\n   public static String getInitials(String name){\n      String firstName = name.substring(0, name.indexOf(\" \"));\n      String firstInit = firstName.substring(0, 1);\n      String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \")+1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n      String middleInit = middleName.substring(0, 1);\n      String lastName = name.substring((name.lastIndexOf(\" \")+1), name.length());\n      String lastInit = lastName.substring(0, 1);\n      String initials = (firstInit + \". \" + middleInit + \". \" + lastInit + \".\");\n      return initials;\n   }\n}\n\nThis is the error zyBooks displays:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: begin 0, end -1, length 3\n    at java.base/java.lang.String.checkBoundsBeginEnd(String.java:3319)\n    at java.base/java.lang.String.substring(String.java:1874)\n    at Initials.getInitials(Initials.java:24)\n    at Initials.main(Initials.java:14)\n\nI know it has something to do with the code trying to access stuff outside of my parameters, but I'm not sure what to tweak to make sure that doesn't happen. I think I need an if statement but I don't know. Any help is appreciated!\nSorry if this post isn't clarified that well. I've been working on this all day and I have a headache.\n",
        "Answer": "String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \") + 1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n\nThis line is a problem when you name only has one space inside it (ex: \"John Doe\"). It will look for a substring between the index of the first space (4 in thsis case) in the name + 1 and the last space which is the same one! So in this case you are asking for a substring between 5 and the lesser 4 which will give an error.\nIf you can, I recommend the split method. This will work with multiple names:\nStringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(\" \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + \". \");\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n\n",

        "Title": "Is a blank try and catch IndexOutOfBoundsException valid at the end of a while loop of if statements in C#?",
        "Question": "I'm finishing an unfinished C# WinForms project, which is a save game editor for an unspecified game. I noticed that character portraits and icons' IDs have a valid range of 1 to 905, but there was no code to verify that the character ID is within that range, so I opted to fix it. I have an in-progress solution to this, with the code for it (with a lot of function names partially redacted) at the end of this post, and wanted to know if it would work. Visual Studio says there are no formatting errors, but I know that alone will not quite be enough. I cannot compile to test because I am not quite at a stage where the code is compilable, with a lot of missing WinForms data. If the specific exception that I placed would not be appropriate, what exception would best fit? If a while loop should not be used in this way, what method should I use that doesn't require rewriting the entire code block from scratch? Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Title": "My code for checking whether a number is a sublime number or not curiously fails for multiples of 12 (a sublime number itself). Does anyone know why?",
        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,... (so the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and I assume every multiple following that sequence afterwards). I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n. If both are true, then I have a sublime number on my hands, if either one or both are false, I don't.\nHere's the error for 12, which is a sublime number:\nsublime(12)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 12-element Vector{Int64} at index [14]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[78]:1\n\nFor comparison, here are the error messages for 24 and 48:\nsublime(24)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 24-element Vector{Int64} at index [30]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[80]:1\n\nsublime(48)\n\nERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 48-element Vector{Int64} at index [62]\nStacktrace:\n [1] setindex!\n   @ .\\array.jl:969 [inlined]\n [2] sublime(n::Int64)\n   @ Main .\\REPL[49]:19\n [3] top-level scope\n   @ REPL[82]:1\n\n\nI hope my information can provide some clues on to solving the current problem!\n",

        "Question": "In this code for quicksort, if input array is decreasing, for example 5 4 3 2 1 , variable i goes on incrementing without check and go out of array bound. Shouldn't that give segmentation error?

        "Answer": "\nShouldn't that give segmentation error?\n\nNo. Segmentation faults are not specified to catch errors of going outside bounds of individual arrays or other objects within a process. They are specified, on operating systems that have them, to catch errors of accessing memory with incorrect permissions for the process, such as attempting to read outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to read, attempting to write outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to write, or attempting to execute instructions outside the bounds of memory the process has permission to execute.\nWhen a process has two arrays, a and b, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a into b will not generate a segmentation fault, because the process has permission to read b. When a process has an array a in the memory allocated (and mapped) for its stack, then reading a[i] with an i that extends outside of a but is still within its stack space will not generate a segmentation fault.\n\nWhy does the code give correct output?\n\nImmediately after swapping a[i] and a[j] inside the do loop, the routine immediately swaps them back, reversing the change. This is because, once i is out of bounds, i<j is false, because j starts at r+1 and is decremented, so we know it is in bounds and hence is less than i. So the loop with while(i<j) terminates, and the code immediately after it, which swaps a[i] and a[j], is executed.\nSo, as long as no segment fault occurs, any swap with an element outside of the array is immediately reversed and has no lasting effect.\n",

        "Question": "I have a very simple SwiftUI app that shows a German word with its English translation. There is a \"Next\" button to cycle through a word list, which is swapped out for a \"Done\" button to restart the list if it is the last word.\nHere is the relevant code:\nstruct ContentView: View {\n  @State private var index = 0\n  \n  var body: some View {\n    let english = Word.words[index].english\n    let german = Word.words[index].german\n    \n    ZStack {\n      Color(\"BackgroundColor\")\n        .ignoresSafeArea()\n      VStack(spacing: 20) {\n        Spacer()\n        TitleView(word: german)\n        CaptionView(word: english)\n        Spacer()\n        if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n          Button {\n            index += 1\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Next Word\")\n          }\n        } else {\n          Button {\n            index = 0\n          } label: {\n            Text(\"Done\")\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nTapping repeatedly on \"Next\" and \"Done\" works as expected: the word list is iterated over and then reset to the beginning.\nHowever, when I tap quickly on these buttons, the app crashes with an Index out of range error. This happens when the \"Done\" button is displayed and tapped on. It also can occur when \"Done\" is not tapped on, but another area of the screen is tapped. As an example: I can alternate my taps between Button and TitleWord, and this will eventually cause the same crash. The only interactive components in the app are these two (conditional) buttons.\nWhat is causing the index to become out of range? It seems like I have introduced a race condition, but I don't know how.\n===\nUpdate:\nI fixed the problem with a simple check before incrementing index:\nif index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n  Button {\n    if index < Word.words.count - 1 {\n      index += 1\n    }\n  } label: {\n    Text(\"Next Word\")\n  }\n} \n\nSince I am repeating the conditional, this tells me that there is indeed a race condition.\n",

        "Question": "On cppreference, I read the following about std::vector<T,Allocator>::operator[]:\n\nAccessing a nonexistent element through this operator is undefined behavior.\n\nDoes the standard draft contain a similar sentence? Or, what part of the standard should I deduce this thing from?\nI guess that if the standard says nothing about it, that would make it UB. But I haven't found anything about std::vector<T,Allocator>::at either, so...\n",
        "Answer": "It's specified in a very roundabout way.\nFirst, the members aren't specified for vector directly, but instead for the general Sequence. You can find the specification here: http://eel.is/c++draft/sequence.reqmts.\nFirst, the obvious part: at has the clause\n\nThrows: out_of_range if n >= a.size().\n\nSo this is where at's behavior comes from.\nAs for [], it says:\n\nReturns: *(a.begin() + n)\n\nSo the effect is the same as of that expression. We need to follow this to find the undefined behavior. For that we need to look at the iterator requirements.\nNow the C++20 requirements are nigh-unreadable, but the C++17 requirements are still there and do apply. So:\n\nhttp://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#random.access.iterators-1 says that a + n (for some iterator a and a difference n) means doing tmp += n for a copy tmp of a.\nSame place says that r += n means repeated applications of ++r (or --r if n is negative).\nIn http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#tab:inputiterator we learn that ++r and *a both have the precondition that r or a respectively are dereferenceable. Note that violating a precondition means undefined behavior in C++ standardese.\n\nThis is where it gets really complicated. At this point we need to piece together the specifications of vector::begin and vector::end to understand that repeated incrementing of v.begin() will eventually (as in, after v.size() applications) yield v.end(), which is specified to be the past-the-end iterator. I cannot find the explicit statement that such iterators are not dereferenceable, but http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.requirements#general-7 specifies that the standard library assumes they are not, and in vector's case this is true.\nTherefore, v[v.size()] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size()), which is equivalent to *v.end(), which is undefined behavior.\nAnd v[v.size()+1] is equivalent to *(v.begin() + v.size() + 1), which is equivalent to *std::next(v.end()), which is incrementing the past-the-end iterator and thus undefined behavior.\n",

In addition, the standard is written to allow (but not require) that array indices can be checked for validity, so even if they're immediately next to each other, the compiler is allowed to check that since you defined x to have 10 elements, any attempt at indexing beyond the 10th element will fail (e.g., cause a hardware interrupt or fault).\nThat leaves the question about how to get the result you apparently want, but with defined behavior.

One is to allocate a single array, and add an alias that allows you to treat half of it as if it were a separate array:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass A{\npublic:\n    double x[20];\n    double *y = &x[10];\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nThe other direction you could go would be to keep the two arrays separate, but then add a small proxy to allow addressing into both arrays as if they were one:\n#include<iostream>\n\nclass proxy {\n    double *x_;\n    size_t N;\n    double *y_;\npublic:\n    template <class T, std::size_t N>\n    proxy(T (&x_)[N], T *y) : x_(x_), N(N), y_(y) {}\n\n    double &operator[](std::size_t n) {\n        if (n < N)\n            return x_[n];\n        else\n            return y_[n-N];\n    }\n};\n\nclass A{\n    double x_[10];\npublic:\n    double y[10];\n    proxy x{x_, y};\n};\n\nint main(){\n    A a;\n    a.y[3] = 14;\n    std::cout << a.x[13] << \"\\n\";\n}\n\nUnless you really need to use separate arrays for the two items, the first is probably preferable \u2013 it's clearly simpler and probably faster.\n",

The variable must be able to be larger than the number of objects in the string array, so far I get \"IndexOutOfRangeException, which is to be expected. I would like it to keep looking and just start over in the array, much like a loop would work.\nSo these are the relevant strings for what I've tried:\nstring alf = (\"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\");\n\nstring[] alflist = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", \"l\", \"m\", \"n\", \"o\", \"p\", \"q\", \"r\", \"s\", \"t\", \"u\", \"v\", \"w\", \"x\", \"y\", \"z\"};\n\n\nWhat I've tried is this:\nstring output = alflist[Encryption.key];\nWhere Encryption.key is called form another class, and this is the int that could be (and in this instance is) larger than the 26 positions of alflist.\nIf Encryption.key = 30 I would like output to be = \"e\" (since a=0 & 26).\nI have also tried to use alf.substring(Encryption.key, 1) but I get the same error.\nThanks for any guidance on this\n",
        "Answer": "You can use the modulus (%) operator. Also, strings can already provide characters by index using the same bracket notation as arrays; there's no need to create a separate array:\nstring alf = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\nint index = Encryption.Key % alf.Length;\nchar result = alf[index];\n\nOr if you need a string instead of a character:\nstring alf = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\nint index = Encryption.Key % alf.Length;\nstring result = alf[index].ToString();\n\nBut if you did want an array, you can could get it like this:\nstring alf = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\";\nvar alfArray = alf.ToCharArray(); // List is not an array.

Or some other logic in your application is incorrect. As @Zabuzard advised, try printing the value of position (or perhaps the contents of the collection) to understand what's going wrong:\noverride fun onBindViewHolder(holder: bomViewHolder, position: Int) {\n  val color=ListTheColorTone[position].color // <= This returns an empty string\n\n  println(\"position: $position\")\n  println(\"ListTheColorTone: ${ListTheColorTone.toList()}\")\n  println(\"color: $color\")\n\n  holder.cardBlack.setCardBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(color!!)) // <= This is the line where the exception is thrown\n}\n\nOr even better, try adding a breakpoint at the line where the exception is thrown and check the value of position and ListTheColorTone.size.

        "Answer": "String middleName = name.substring((name.indexOf(\" \") + 1), name.lastIndexOf(\" \"));\n\nThis line is a problem when you name only has one space inside it (ex: \"John Doe\"). It will look for a substring between the index of the first space (4 in thsis case) in the name + 1 and the last space which is the same one! So in this case you are asking for a substring between 5 and the lesser 4 which will give an error.\nIf you can, I recommend the split method. This will work with multiple names:\nStringBuilder initials = new StringBuilder(new String());\nString[] individualNames = name.split(\" \");\nfor (int i = 0; i < individualNames.length; i++) {\n  initials.append(individualNames[i].substring(0, 1) + \". \");\n}\nSystem.out.println(initials);\n\n",

I noticed that character portraits and icons' IDs have a valid range of 1 to 905, but there was no code to verify that the character ID is within that range, so I opted to fix it. I have an in-progress solution to this, with the code for it (with a lot of function names partially redacted) at the end of this post, and wanted to know if it would work. Visual Studio says there are no formatting errors, but I know that alone will not quite be enough. I cannot compile to test because I am not quite at a stage where the code is compilable, with a lot of missing WinForms data. If the specific exception that I placed would not be appropriate, what exception would best fit? If a while loop should not be used in this way, what method should I use that doesn't require rewriting the entire code block from scratch? Here is the relevant code I have so far:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        while (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            if (ID < 10)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n            }\n            else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n            {\n                pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n                pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                try { }\n                catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n                {\n                    ID = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nI have not yet been able to try or test anything yet; this is merely a question regarding the valid use of C# code. I also saw just 1 question that was similar, but not the same, as my question in the 'possibly related questions' section before posting this, although it did partially indicate that what I am doing may be okay. I am expecting the code to throw IndexOutOfBoundsException if ID is greater than 905, and read the proper image file if not.\nEdit: Okay, I have revised the code significantly, using feedback posted here. I have ended up with the following code, which shows no errors in Visual Studio, and despite others saying 'it is improper to use exceptions to control flow', works for my use case. Also, I am technically not using them to control anything, just that I want an exception window to pop up for anyone who has a save file with a character ID greater than 905, so that they know that their save file is likely corrupted. I want the program to still be able to continue operation afterward, and not have this error be fatal. Here is the revised code:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n    short ID = 0;\n    if (slot == 1)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n        }\n\n        catch (System.FormatException)\n        {\n            ID = 0;\n        }\n\n        if (ID < 10)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"00\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon00\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 9 && ID < 100)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"0\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon0\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 99 && ID < 906)\n        {\n            pictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"\" + ID);\n            pictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject(\"icon\" + ID);\n        }\n\n        else if (ID > 905)\n        {\n            throw(System.InvalidOperationException);\n            ID = 0;\n            continue;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n",
        "Answer": "ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n\nThis is a custom method. Rather than wrap it in a try/catch, make it return the default 0 value. While I'm here, that comboBox should also be given as an argument to the getImage() method (and the potriat/icon pair returned as a result, maybe in a tuple).\nI understand you might not have that option, and assuming you have a legitimate need to use it instead of a simple int.Parse() or int.TryParse(), or if it's used in other places and expected to throw. In that case, I then look at the catch value and see this:\nID = 0\n\n... and then notice this:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nPut them together, and we can just exit the method right away.\ntry\n{\n    ID = convertStringtoID(comboBoxSlot1ID.Text);\n}\ncatch ()\n{\n     return;\n}\n\nLooking more at this loop:\nwhile (ID > 0 && ID < 906)\n\nNothing inside that loop ever changes ID, so the loop would run forever. You want if() instead of while().\nI also see the conditional expressions used to decide how many 0s you need to prefix the ID value. You can replace all that like this:\npictureBoxSlot1Portrait.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\npictureBoxSlot1Icon.Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nAnother item, for the question about the empty try:\n else\n {\n     try { }\n     catch (System.IndexOutOfRangeException)\n     {\n         ID = 0;\n     }\n}\n\nThe try has nothing in it, least of all anything that would ever throw an exception, and therefore the catch will NEVER run. It seems like you just want this:\nelse\n{\n    ID = 0;\n}\n\nAnd I need to caution here about using exceptions for program logic control flow in the first place. It's extremely poor practice. Rather, exceptions should reserved for events that are genuinely exceptional or unexpected.\nBut really, I'd skip that else() completely, since we already know logically from the checks made when entering the block that the value is in the expected range.\nFinally, I saw this comment:\n\nslot has a valid range of 1 to 3 ... after the section of code I listed is the exact same code posted twice more, only used for slots 2 and 3 instead.\n\nWe can improve on that like this:\nif (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return;\nvar portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\nvar icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\nvar combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\nAnd then use the new array variables when needed:\nID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n// ...\nportraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\nicons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");\n\nEven better if the arrays are defined for this at the class level, to avoid fresh allocations each time this runs, but I'll leave that change for another time.\nPut it all together, and the method reduces to this:\nvoid getImage(int slot)\n{\n   if (--slot < 0 || slot > 2) return; //also adjusts from 1-based slot to 0-based array index\n\n   var portraits = new PictureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Portrait, pictureBoxSlot2Portrait, pictureBoxSlot3Portrait};\n   var icons = new PicutureBox[] {pictureBoxSlot1Icon, pictureBoxSlot2Icon, pictureBoxSlot3Icon};\n   var combos = new ComboBox[] {comboBoxSlot1ID, comboBoxSlot2ID, comboBoxSlot3ID};\n\n   short ID = 0;\n   try {\n      ID = convertStringtoID(combos[slot].Text);\n   } catch() { return; }\n\n   if (ID <= 0 || ID >= 906) return;\n\n   portraits[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"{ID:000}\");\n   icons[slot].Image = (Image)Properties.Resources.ResourceManager.GetObject($\"dot{ID:000}\");     \n}\n\nThis now works with only about 1/6 the code of the original and saves three levels of indentation. That it will also be faster is just a bonus.\nThere are further improvements that can be made as well, to better decouple the UI from the back end and simplify the code, but this is enough for today. But it's worth repeating here that the only exception ever thrown or even tested is for the convertStringtoID() method, which could likely be rewritten to avoid the need. No other try/catch is needed.\n",

        "Title": "OutOfBoundsException when converting Java.awt.Polygon to a LibGDX polygon",
        "Question": "Introduction\nI have been attempting to draw filled polygons using LibGDX's ShapeRenderer by converting Java.awt.Polygon into float arrays, then passing these into the ShapeRenderer's polygon(float[]) method. I have noticed that for polygons with a large amount of npoints (in this case 4370), I keep getting an IndexOutOfBoundsException. This does not occur with smaller sized polygons.\nHere I iterate over my Province objects which have their own Polygons, from these I gather the x, y and npoints and create a float array.\nfor (Province p : map.getProvinces()) { shapeRenderer.setColor(p.getColor());\n    // Convert the Polygon's vertices to a float array\n    int[] xpoints = p.getPolygon().xpoints;\n    int[] ypoints = p.getPolygon().ypoints;\n    float[] verticesArray = new float[p.getPolygon().npoints * 2];\n    \n    for (int i = 0; i < p.getPolygon().npoints; i++) {\n        verticesArray[i * 2] = xpoints[i];\n        verticesArray[i * 2 + 1] = ypoints[i];\n    }\n    \n    shapeRenderer.polygon(verticesArray); //IndexOutOfBoundsException: tried accessing index 20003 but bound is 20000\n}\n\nWhat I've tried\nI have been using print statements to see what i was exactly passing into the polygon method:\nNpoints: 550\nXpoints: [3042, 3043, 3044, 3045, 3046, 3047, 3048, 3049, 3050,... etc]\nYpoints: [1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068, 1068,... etc]\nid: 1\nrgb: -32769\n\nNpoints: 449\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 2\nrgb: -49153\n\nNpoints: 515\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 3\nrgb: -16385\n\nNpoints: 4370\nXpoints:[...etc]\nYpoints:[...etc]\nid: 4\nrgb: -1\n\n// Exception \n\nAs mentioned earlier the only noticeable thing here (for me at least) was the last polygon's large number of Npoints, leading to my description in the introduction. I'm not actually sure if this is the cause of the issue or if it's completely unrelated.\nI decided to dig a bit deeper and looked at the Callstack.\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 20003 out of bounds for length 20000\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ImmediateModeRenderer20.color(ImmediateModeRenderer20.java:121)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1132)\n    at com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShapeRenderer.polygon(ShapeRenderer.java:1141)\n    at com.mygdx.game.Actor.draw(Actor.java:66)\n\nI then decided to look at line 121 of ImmediateModeRenderer20.java, where i found:\npublic void color (float colorBits) {\n     vertices[vertexIdx + colorOffset] = colorBits;\n}\n\nI then modified this source code by removing the \"+ colorOffset\", since I thought perhaps this value was 3 (20000 + 3). Nope, same error.\nI guess a more general question would be, how does one convert java polygons so they can be drawn with LibGDX, since perhaps I am approaching this problem incorrectly.\n",
        "Answer": "Turns out, there was no problem with the float array I was passing. The Shaperenderer initializes a ImmediateModeRenderer20 instance with a default vertices value of 5000. By this point I noticed there were alternative consturctors for Shaperenderer with an argument to manually set the limit. I just did\nShaperenderer sr = new Shaperenderer(10000000) \n\nAnd this solved the issue.\n",

        "Question": "I'm new to Julia and was coding a bit for fun. My current project was creating code for checking whether a number is sublime or not. For context (and a bit of trivia I suppose), a sublime number n is defined by two qualities:\n\nthe number of divisors (including n) is a perfect number\nthe sum of the divisors (including n) is a perfect number\n(perfect numbers have the quality that the sum of their divisors - not including the number itself -  add up to the number itself)\n\n12 is a sublime number, and I suspect that is the reason I get the error message for most of its multiples.\nMy code (seen below - I'm new to Julia so be prepared for inefficiences) works as it should for any other number.\nThe BoundsError message appears for every multiple of 12 except for 36, 72, 144, 288,... (so the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 24th, and I assume every multiple following that sequence afterwards). I'd be very interested to know why and very grateful if someone were able to help.\nHere's the code:\nfunction sublime(n)\n           ncheck = zeros(Int64, n)\n           k = 1\n\n               for k = 1:n\n                   if rem(n,k) == 0\n                       ncheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           ncheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, ncheck)\n\n           divsum = sum(ncheck)\n           sumcheck = zeros(Int64, divsum)\n               for k = 1:(divsum-1)\n                   if rem(divsum, k) == 0\n                       sumcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           sumcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, sumcheck)\n\n           divnum = size(ncheck,1)\n           lcheck = zeros(Int64, divnum)\n               for k = 1:(divnum-1)\n                   if rem(divnum, k) == 0\n                       lcheck[k] = k\n                   else\n                       #do nothing\n                   end\n               end\n           lcheck = filter!(x -> x != 0, lcheck)\n\n           if sum(lcheck) == divnum & sum(sumcheck) == divsum\n               println(\"y\")\n           else\n               println(\"n\")\n           end\n       end\n\n\nBasically, I'm creating an array (called \"ncheck\") of length n with only zeroes, checking which numbers k < n result have a remainder of 0, updating the array to include those k, and deleting every 0.\nThen I create an array \"sumcheck\" with length \"divsum\", meaning the sum of the divisors of n. I repeat the above process. Check what gives me a remainder of 0 and delete the remaining zeroes in the array.\nThe final array is \"lcheck\" with length \"divnum\", meaning the number of divisors of n. Same process as above, only those divisors with a remainder of 0 remain.\nFinally, I check whether the sum of the entries in lcheck are equal to the length of ncheck and the sum of entries in sumcheck are equal to sum of divisors in n.

First thing I found out was that this exception is not raised if ListView is not the active screen(because Listview is not recomposed). Also after looking at the stack trace my assumption is that this issue has something to do with the internal jetpack compose libraries or the way I have implemented the composable function i.e. Lazycolumn.\n",

        "Title": "Array Index Out Of Bounds Error When Computing Generalized Harmonic Numbers",
        "Question": "Beginner to java. Trying to make code that takes 2 command line arguments (n, r) and uses a for loop to compute the nth generalized harmonic number of order r.\nI keep getting the error \"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\" and I have no idea why. In the loop, I have tried i < n and i<=n and keep getting the same result.\nHere is the code:\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);\n        int r = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);\n        float sum = 0;\n        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n            sum += 1 / Math.pow(i, r);\n        }\n        System.out.println(sum);\n    }\n}\n\nEdit: I am running the program from the mac command line and it's not letting me enter arguments at all. Sorry if this is missing something very obvious.\n",
        "Answer": "I believe the error has nothing to do with your harmonic numbers. Input values are the problem. If you look into the exception carefully you will see that it is thrown at the line where you extract the parameters from the command line arguments args[N]. For that is the only place where you operate with arrays in your code.\nTry this code:\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    if (args.length != 2) {\n        System.out.println(\"The program requires 2 arguments. You provided \" + args.length);\n        return;\n    }\n    int n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);\n    int r = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);\n    float sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {\n        sum += 1 / Math.pow(i, r);\n    }\n    System.out.println(sum);\n}\n\nYou will see that your arguments are somehow not provided. Check how do you run your program.\n",

        "Answer": "In addition to a List being null, it might also be empty (contain nothing). In this case that is exactly the problem. There is nothing in the List, so you can't get the first element (there isn't one). One solution, check for empty. Like,\nList<MetamodelField> entityList = getDao().findByExample(ex);\nif (!entityList.isEmpty()) {\n    entityList.get(0);\n    remove(entityList.get(0));\n}\n\nOr use an Iterator. Like,\nList<MetamodelField> entityList = getDao().findByExample(ex);\nIterator<MetamodelField> iter = entityList.iterator();\nif (iter.hasNext()) {\n    MetamodelField mf = iter.next();\n    iter.remove();\n}\n\n",
