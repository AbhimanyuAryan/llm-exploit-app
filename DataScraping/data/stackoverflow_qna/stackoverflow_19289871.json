So you probably can't increase it in Linux (sidenote: it seems that in Solaris <a href=\"http://www.science.uva.nl/pub/solaris/solaris2.html#q3.61\" rel=\"nofollow\">you can</a>).</p>\n\n<p>But you can probably make some room by killing some other clients. Use <code>xlsclients</code> to list them, stop the unnecessary ones, and see if that works for you.</p>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19289871/xlib-connection-to-0-0-refused-by-server-xlib-maximum-number-of-clients-rea"}
