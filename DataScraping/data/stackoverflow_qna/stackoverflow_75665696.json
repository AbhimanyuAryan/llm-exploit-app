Setting <code>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</code> to <code>NO</code> in your info.plist is all that is required.</p>\n<p>If the answer is that you are using standard encryption algorithms instead of or in addition to Apple's libraries then you need to set <code>ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption</code> to <code>YES</code>. You will also need to <a href=\"https://help.apple.com/app-store-connect/#/dev38f592ac9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">submit the required documentation for France to Apple</a>.</p>\n<p>Once Apple have reviewed and approved your documents they will provide a value that you specify for the key <code>ITSEncryptionExportComplianceCode</code> in your Info.plist file.</p>\n", "questionSource": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75665696/how-to-manage-missing-compliance-automatically-on-app-store-test-flight"}
