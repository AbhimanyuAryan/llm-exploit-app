# Data Mining Practical Assignment

- Step 0 - define objectives and data source(s) to use -> define
  title and objectives (on google sheet) by March 8 th
- Step 1 – choose LLM; plan the development tasks; create
  project repository -> presentation on March 22 nd
- Step 2 – development of the project: software for data
  collection, LLM exploration and integration -> presentation on
  May 26 th
- Step 3 – final article writing and final repository updates ->
  until June 16th

#### Ways to integrate knowledge in the LLM:

- One-shot or few shot learning, i.e. by simply providing context to the LLM, as well as other forms of prompt engineering
- Retrieval augmented generation, encoding available knowledge in vector databases or other forms
- LLM refinement by re-training or using RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback)
- Other architectures of integration of LLMs with other tools: ReWOO, agent-based LLMs, planning, etc.

### Practical project – one possible option - Kaggle –

AI Assistants for Data Tasks with Gemma

- Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured the world's attention and
  imagination.
- Much of their potential lies in their ability to be adapted to accomplish
  specialized tasks for a seemingly unlimited number of use cases.
- There’s a massive opportunity to uncover the best methods and
  approaches for adapting LLMs to new and specialized use cases.
- The goal of this competition is to create a notebook that demonstrates
  how to use the Gemma LLM to accomplish a data science oriented task

### Practical project – other options - examples

Possible ideas:

- Develop a chatbot that can provide advice and discuss topics related with good food
  habits (e.g. integrating with scientific or other specialized literature)
- Develop an AI assistant that work as a PT (personalized trainer) helping to define
  training plans and discussing advantages or disadvantages of specific exercises and
  fitness plans (e.g. to loose weight, for specific health issues or fitness targets, etc)
- Develop a tutor for mathematics for given school levels
- Develop a chatbot that is a political or a sports commentator
- Develop a chatbot that can suggest specific service providers or products in different
  areas (e.g. integrating the LLM with a web browser or with a product or service
  catalog)
